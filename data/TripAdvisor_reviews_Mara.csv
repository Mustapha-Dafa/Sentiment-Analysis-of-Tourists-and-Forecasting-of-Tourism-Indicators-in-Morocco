Authentic Moroccan experience,The staff at this hotel are so attentive. All your requests and needs are met immediately. The rooms are large and decorated in authentic traditional Moroccan style. At first getting to your room is like being in a maze with so many courtyards and corridors but you soon find your way. Very private and no outside noise except you can hear the birds singing. The breakfast and afternoon tea are very refreshing. Two restaurants on site if you arrive jet lagged you don’t have to go out. All in all a wonderful experience and I would stay there again. Highly recommend this hotel.,La Maison Arabe,Hotel,Marrakech
Fantastic stay ✨,"Excellent location excellent staff turn to customers, especially Mr. Driss at the front desk. 
We had a great stay thanks to all of you",La Maison Arabe,Hotel,Marrakech
A must-see in Marrakech,"Very good workshop! We cooked 2 types DE sala DE Moroccans (taktouka and courgettes), a fish tagine, and an almond and orange blossom pastilla. Very good menu that shows the techniques to use to cook a Tajine. We learned a lot DE Moroccan cuisine (not just these dishes). DE addition, it is a wonderful human experience: Naila and Dada are incredibly kind. It’s a perfect course for all levels, then eating the final product in the beautiful dining room is a sublime experience.",La Maison Arabe,Hotel,Marrakech
Magical Marrakech,"We not only had a wonderful experience at your hotel but your city was amazing. The La Maison Arabe property is very lovely. The spa was under renovation but we had a beautiful experience nonetheless. Each room and nook were beautifully decorated all very traditional and welcoming. We loved wandering through on the way to the piano jazz bar. What an absolute treat to have such talented musicians every night !! The bartenders made exceptionally crafted drinks. We enjoyed many nights at the lounge. Also that cinnamon smell radiating when you walk in reception was yummy. The staff…
All the staff that we encounter were absolutely amazing. They went out of their way to make us feel welcomed and they were so very accommodating to our needs. They truly are the reason we would recommend the hotel and come back to stay. We truly feel they were exceptional. 
The cooking class was outstanding! 
The 3 hours flew by. We all agreed that the cooking experience was the best of all our activities that we scheduled for our entire stay. Walking distance from the markets and Bahia Palace as well as the Saadian Tombs",La Maison Arabe,Hotel,Marrakech
Magical stay in this historic hotel.,"Incredible stay at the hotel. The grounds of this historic hotel can’t be matched. The staff is so incredibly warm, kind, and knowledgeable. They made my stay one I will remember forever. I traveled alone and felt safe and looked after by the hotel team every day. I will always come back here when I am in Marrakech. Beautiful city with beautiful people. 

If you want a magical visit, this hotel is the place to stay…",La Maison Arabe,Hotel,Marrakech
"The cooking workshop, exceptional recipes","Chef Rachida and the sales manager explained the recipes well and it was very rewarding.
Thank you for the tea master DE ceremonies with his captivating explanations.",La Maison Arabe,Hotel,Marrakech
Second visit to this wonderful hotel.,"La Maison Arabe is an excellent and peaceful hotel in a very good location for exploring the Medina and also further afield; we walked to the Jardin Majorelle and Gueliz in less than thirty minutes.
The hotel rooms and public spaces are beautifully decorated in traditional Moroccan style and everything is very clean and well maintained. 
The hotel's country club is a great facility just outside the city, great place to go in the afternoon heat to enjoy the pool and relax. 
The food is great, the breakfast buffet has a very wide choice and the restaurant in the evening has an excellent menu and very interesting wine list featuring mainly Moroccan wines, which we rate highly.  We also enjoyed the roof top bar for more casual dining. 
Although we find everything about this hotel to be excellent, the most impressive aspect of La Maison Arabe is definitely its staff. They could not be any more helpful or friendly, they are a real asset to the hotel.
This was our second visit to this wonderful hotel, and we will definitely return.",La Maison Arabe,Hotel,Marrakech
The absolute best!,"I can’t say enough about Maison Arabe. I have had the great fortune of traveling and it’s the most wonderful, magical place I’ve ever stayed. The staff is exemplary!!! The food is amazing. My only disappointment is the pool was closed and we learned having dinner there is highly recommended. I can’t say enough about the staff! I felt like a princess. In fact, I get choked up thinking about how kind everyone was. A special thanks to Hakim, Redwane, the bar tender and another gentleman who also worked at the front desk. Everyone was special!! I hope to return one day!",La Maison Arabe,Hotel,Marrakech
"Luxurious, authentic and historic.","We were very pleasantly surprised by La Maison Arabe, when booking we didn't study it much but the service was 5* from the moment we booked. The hotel refunded us for an extra day we accidentally booked which was very kind. They knew I'd recently been in a traffic accident in the UK so they organised a 4x4 car to pick us up from the airport for free. The team were highly professional and warm spirited throughout our stay. They helped us organise trips, taxis and offered daily advice. Our room was immaculate, opulent yet homely and felt luxurious. I've tried to recreate our stay at home by buying orange blossom essence, brass hooks and towel robes :)

The hotel has a jazz piano bar and lots of history too. I think Winston Churchill was a frequent visitor. 

As someone who cannot eat gluten or dairy I often find hotel breakfast difficult. However the food was great! I had almond milk in my coffee and plenty of options for food; omelette, fresh figs, fresh beetroot juice, savoury options, fruit, quinoa and more. 

At the time of visiting the pool was under construction so the hotel had an hourly shuttle which took us to their second private property which has a fabulous luxury outdoor pool set in hectors of gardens and in a beautiful setting. I would have liked to have known about this before arriving, but they certainly redeemed themselves. 

My only criticism was that one of the taxis they booked us during the week didn't have seatbelts, but perhaps they didn't know that when booking. And, that the fallback pool didn't serve alcohol like the hotel did. But the lunch we ordered was delicious. 

The hotel is very well located and we mostly walked everyday to our destinations. On arrival we booked a walking tour which was such a great idea as we saw so much of the local area and the guide over indexed on the arts which is our passion. 

I'd definitely return here again!",La Maison Arabe,Hotel,Marrakech
Unforgettable getaway to the Arab House,"In addition to being a mythical Palace, the welcome was perfect for all the staff with a welcome mocktail and every day a tea time/pastry served at 5pm in the patio and its fountain. Perfect room and bathroom with welcome bottle Cafe/the.",La Maison Arabe,Hotel,Marrakech
Perfect Place to stay,"If I could give this place 10 stars I would. The level of service is on point. Beautiful
Grounds, the food is delicious, the entire staff is attentive and kind. They have wonderful recommendations for places to eat and things to do. Guest services created an amazing experience for my child’s birthday. Ismail by the pool is the BEST. He anticipated our wants and needs and made our trip effortless.",Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Hotel,Marrakech
Definitely not Four Seasons standard,"Poor Service all around 
Had to wait an hour at the pool to get someone to get. Me drinks
Also had to ask several times to get them to call a taxi for me
The House keeping dept is very inconsistent. Half the time they  don't replace face ir hand towels",Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Hotel,Marrakech
A Magical Stay for the Whole Family – Highly Recommended! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️,"We recently stayed at the Four Seasons Marrakech as a family of three (two adults and our three-year-old son), and it was a truly unforgettable experience. From the moment we arrived, we were greeted with warm smiles and exceptional service. The staff were incredibly attentive, polite, and genuinely welcoming.

The resort itself is stunning – lush gardens, serene walkways, beautiful architecture, and a peaceful atmosphere. Our son had an amazing time, especially at the family pool, where the staff were absolutely fantastic. A very special thanks to Mr. Ismail and the entire team at the family pool – they were kind, professional, and consistently went out of their way to make us feel comfortable and well cared for.

The overall experience was flawless, and we deeply appreciated how family-friendly and accommodating the hotel was. We made some amazing memories here, and we’re already looking forward to our next visit. If you’re traveling to Marrakech with children, this place is a must!",Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Hotel,Marrakech
An enjoyable stay but somewhat mixed in terms of service.,"I spent a week in Marrakech, splitting my stay between a resort on the outskirts of town and a 3-night stay at Four Seasons to explore the city. After an exceptional experience at the first resort, the Four Seasons proved less consistent in service. That said, the hotel does have some great staff amongst the team - particular thanks to Fatima and Hisham. 

Unlike most hotels, at the Four Seasons Marrakech many staff fail to acknowledge guests with a greeting when passing in public spaces, which diminished from the feeling of welcome.

Further details on the stay… 

> Arrival:
On arrival, only one receptionist was present and already occupied, leading to a short delay. During this time, a welcoming young gent offered Moroccan tea. The formalities of checkin were paired with some unnecessary personal commentary from the receptionist - enquiring on whether I enjoyed solo travel (as she did not) and later remarking on my lack of a tan.

> Room:
I was initially assigned a Garden Patio room, but construction noise prompted a move. This was expertly handled by the front desk supervisor, who arranged an Upper Pavilion room. This room was light-filled, spacious and well-appointed, with generous outdoor seating and peaceful garden views. It is also detached from the main building and felt private. Housekeeping was good, with the notable exception of missing turndown service on the second evening. As for sleep quality, the bed was the usual Four Seasons high quality however the aircon not very effective (even on the lowest setting & after being checked). 

> Hotel & Grounds:
It’s a lovely resort, and the architecture features some nice Moroccan touches - most notably the grand water feature leading to the main building and the indoor décor. Despite its proximity to the city, the hotel grounds are expansive and very enjoyable to stroll. Aircon in the lobby and reception area was inadequate.  

During my stay the hotel was undergoing maintenance, which had not been disclosed at time of booking or on their website. This included the closure of the adults-only pool, leaving only the rather noisy family pool available. After raising this with management, they offered access to the pool in one of their villas. Service from Hisham, the waiter there, was outstanding - a contrast to the main pool, where on my first day staff were disengaged and guests needed to seek out staff / approach the bar themselves.

> Spa:
The massage was relaxing. It was however one of the smallest treatment rooms I’ve been in with some ill fitting curtain making the room brighter than it should be. 

> Dining:
Breakfast at Quattro was very enjoyable. There was a comprehensive buffet with local and international selections, eggs made to order, and a great selection of fruit juices. Staff were friendly and it was a lovely setting for outdoor dining.

Lunch at Azzera was underwhelming. The vegan cobb salad was beautifully presented, but would have benefited from a sauce. Despite an empty well staffed venue, service was inattentive - no one checked on the meal after it was served, water wasn’t replenished, and the table wasn’t cleared for some time after dining.

Early evening drinks at Inara on the first night were forgettable - neither the bartender nor waitress knew what a Daiquiri was. 

Zest Rooftop was a standout however - lovely views, good service, tasty cocktails, a DJ, and an enjoyable Asian-inspired menu.

Finally, a note on vegetarian options: beyond salads and pasta, these were limited across all main menus including room service menu. I also had to repeatedly remind staff of a nut allergy, which most premium hotels note at check-in or after the first interaction when dining.",Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Hotel,Marrakech
Superb service and experience. The service at fourseasons was awesome from the moment we arrived.,"Sheer excellence at fourseasons. Service was of the highest order, staff were genuine, friendly and helpful. We spent 2 weeks here and every day was warmly received from all staff members, no matter what their role. Great food options, beautiful breakfast everyday overlooking the waterfalls. Would recommend a Hamman and massage at the Spa and the hotel offer great trip options from trips into the Medina through to the Atlas mountains and YSL gardens. The staff really made this stay special, was a 10/10 stay for us. Special,call out to Addessamad, Ishmael, Mohammed from the pool area and Mohammed from Zest restaurant. Our first trip to both Marrakech and Morocco and we will be back, in the main thanks to fourseasons hotel and their staff.",Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Hotel,Marrakech
Beautiful resort with spacious lovely rooms………worst food and awful menus. It’s hard to believe that in a Four Seaaons.,"The arrival staff  and checkin staff were excellent and we were upgraded to a beautiful spacious room.
After being in Morocco for a week and traveling to different hotels and restaurants and eating amazing fresh Moroccan cuisine it’s hard to believe that this property offered an American style rubbish menu and food to match.
They can’t even make a nice salad.
Highly disappointing.
Avoid eating here.",Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Hotel,Marrakech
Just an airport hotel?,"Just very average, rooms are dated and not special. It seems the public areas of the hotel have been made to look special for visitors but when you actually go to your room is completely different.

I overheard another guest saying it’s so convenient being 10 minutes away from the airport. If you are looking for that this will tick the box. 

There was also construction work happening that we were not informed about during the booking or prior to arrival.   

Very disappointing",Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Hotel,Marrakech
Outstanding,"The most beautiful hotel ever . The staff are incredible, kind and attentive . Food was divine and the whole place is immaculate. It’s peaceful, wonderful and feels like an absolute treat to be there.  My two daughters also enjoyed kids club for a few hours a day and they loved it. 100/10 and didn’t want to leave!",Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Hotel,Marrakech
Fabulous,"Top notch service from communication prior to arrival, arrival-everything in between! The grounds are gorgeous, our room-the one bedroom patio sweet with the Plunge pool was fantastic. Restaurants, roof top bar and spa all exceptional",Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Hotel,Marrakech

Five Star Experience!!,The Riad Kheirredine was just AMAZING!! The service from beginning to end was something I have never experienced even as a seasoned traveler. The staff treated us like family and serviced our every need and were very warm and inviting. The property gives you the Moroccan vibe and at the same time it has a modern feel. We are planning a trip back in the near future. I highly recommend this property. You won’t be disappointed!!,Riad Kheirredine,Hotel,Marrakech
The best Riad in Morocco - there aren't enough superlatives,"After spending one night in Marrakech and another in the Agafay Desert, we locked in for the main event and stayed @riadkheirredine for 4 days and 3 nights. I am prone to superlatives but of the 50+ countries and hundreds of hotels that I’ve stayed in, the people at Riad Kheirridine stand above them all. There's no sense in reading any other review because I'm telling you point blank - the answer is Riad Kheirredine.

We absolutely LOVED Marrakech - from shopping for artisan-crafted goods (not just fake stuff from China) in the Souk to the outstanding food, this is a city (and Riad) that i will recommend to everyone i know. It's enchantment from movies is all accurate; a true jewel of Africa.

All of this would have made it an incredible trip on its own but I fell madly in love with the team @riadkheirredine. Why am I so effusive in my praise? They made Morocco accessible and calm and easy in a place that could feel overwhelming and insurmountable. Are you still a little bit unsure about the trip? Go to Kheirredine. 

First, they have someone who always walks with you in the medina and have three meeting points so you always feel safe and comfortable without knowing more than “shukran” in Arabic. It’s especially helpful at night; never once did I feel unsafe because I had a friendly buddy to guide us everywhere. 

The Riad gives you a smartphone and you text when you need ANYTHING - they arrange ALL the taxis so you feel safe and get the right price. You know how nice it is to know that you’re not a mark? You save so much money that way it practically pays for the Riad stay. It takes all the stress and anxiety away. All you do is send a text and you get someone to escort you and give you guidance in perfect English or French and a get-to-know-you conversation that brings enrichment to the experience. I became friends with all of the guys who were our guides. Ayoub is such a great guy and the boys at night - Ismail and Noureddine - were so cool and made us feel safe.

Fadwa is the hostess and front of house who plans everything after learning what you are looking for in the experience. If I owned a Riad I would ask her to name her salary because she is the key for the Riad and for us the most important person in Morocco to make the trip exceptional. Her warmth and hospitality made it feel like we’ve known her for years. She is intelligent and socially adept at understanding what kind of experience you're looking to have.  She stands above all and truly was integral to the trip. Listen - if you want to go to Morocco - you need to know her. She is the best of the best. The entire front office bends over backwards to help. I loved Karim, too - he's the smiling, cool guy who helps the Riad run flawlessly.

Amazing right? But that’s still not all of it. The Marrakech trip was made by the kindness of the entire team. 

My personal highlight was being invited by one of the staff members (Ahmed - my first friend who bridged the cultural gap) on day ONE to break fast with the staff at Iftar after the sun set. It’s Ramadan so each evening the team gets together which shows the closeness and family atmosphere of the Riad. Ahmed was the blink to open my eyes to Morocco.

I love cultures and food so I was ecstatic to be welcomed in after such a short time. Think of that - the first day they welcomed me into an intimate gathering that is for them and their beliefs. It made me reflect on how guarded and almost standoffish western culture is in terms of bringing in people who are different than us. Energy spent on exclusion is wasted; energy spent of welcoming those who seek to understand creates lifelong memories and friendship.

The three Iftar experiences are moments that I will cherish; conversations that ranged from Morocco and culture to the USA to their families (King of Kindness Mohamed is kid #13 in his family - 6 brothers and 6 sisters who grew up in the Sahara desert) to the status of cats in Morocco (A cat Kingdom 🐈 👑). The “Uncle” of the group is a gentle and kind man named Mehdi. We talked about travel and movies and I’m so stoked when he’ll get to fulfill his dream trip to Italy in the Fall. When was the last time you were shown pictures in a hot air balloon from someone at a Courtyard Marriott? I am proud to say that I will know Mehdi forever. My dude Rabbi is an aspiring rapper and so cool that I could drop him into Toronto or LA and he'd thrive. You’ll hear his tracks on my IG stories. The coolest cat with the moustache is Saleh and he'll make you the best drinks. The unlimited complimentary fresh-squeezed orange juice was out of this world and Khalid and Aymane would be looking for me to give me more. 

I always say that culture is the sharing of stories. People make a place great and the Moroccans we met @riadkheirredine showed me their culture in the greatest ways. 

If you want to go - and you should, trust me - you'll have the best time at Kherrredine. Move it up your list and find Fadwa. It'll be the trip of a lifetime.",Riad Kheirredine,Hotel,Marrakech
A fantastic riad in Marrakech,"We're a family of four whom had a wonderful stay at the riad. From the point when we arrived until we left was packed with great moments, excellent food, superfriendly people and very nice rooms. The people made us feel as we were home. Only regret is that the riad was closed when we returned back to Marrakech. A stay far beyond expectations.",Riad Kheirredine,Hotel,Marrakech
Amazing stay at Riad Kheirredine,"Its hard to describe how beautiful this place is. My wife and I have travelled extensively and we both agree this is , overall, the nicest place we have stayed. We were upgraded to a beautiful suite with a large living room and a nice wrap around balcony overlooking one of the courtyards in the riad. Everything here is an 11 out of 10 - the service, the food and drink and the incredibly gracious staff. We also utilized the spa and did the traditional hammam experience with a massage.  The Riad is located within the medina and it is a short walk to all of the shops etc. We loved the location.
We really enjoyed relaxing on the rooftop of the Riad .  In the evening, we would have a drink at the rooftop bar and then eventually sit at one of the rooftop tables and enjoy a leisurely dinner. We also had a fantastic breakfast on the rooftop every morning.  Honestly, we did not want to leave. Thankyou for a wonderful experience. If we ever go back to Marrakech, we will defintely be staying at Riad Kheirredine.",Riad Kheirredine,Hotel,Marrakech
This is the best place you will ever stay!,"Best experience of our life! I'm telling you, this was the most wonderful stay we've had in all our travels around the world. 
They ordered our driver to pick us up. He was waiting upon arrival. Drove us to the location near riad where the staff was waiting to take all our luggage to the riad. While you're walking to get to the riad, you think OMG, is this going to be ok? Then you walk in to Riad Kheirredine and all your worries fade away! Drinks upon entering, the staff, especially Fadwa made you feel right at home. She showed us every aspect of the riad, all the stunning rooms, food menu, pools, spa facilities, etc. When I say, stunning, I mean stunning. Everyone greets you by name. Our first evening we had Moroccan menu on rooftop and our waiter treated us like royalty. The food was marvelous! Our room was stunning as well! Our bed was a Euro King, which if you know, you know! Loved it! We had a  twin bed for our teen daughter. So comfy. Dark room so you can sleep peacefully. Birds chirping in the morning. Food can be ordered if you want it to the room. 
The Riad also provides you with a cell phone so when you're out in the Medina or walking around and need anything you text them, they will respond and order you a Tuk Tuk or taxi to get you back to a meeting point and one of the staff will come pick you up!! 
We had 3 massages at the spa and it was the best massage I've had. My husband, daughter and I all agreed it was fantastic! They come to your room, hand you your robes, then you follow the ladies to the spa where you are pampered and rubbed. After, you can sit in the serene spa area where you drink tea, have some cookies and relax as long as you'd like. 
Laundry service is included in your stay which was great for us as we had been traveling for about a month in Spain before we arrived. Clothes were laundered and pressed very quickly and hung in room after our day out. 
The breakfast which was included with our stay was so fresh! Juice, fruits, eggs, bread, etc. 
In case you haven't noticed, we truly loved every single bit of our stay. It's a nice reprieve from the hustle and bustle of Marrakech city center and everyone felt like family. 
The owner of this riad knows how to do it right! She's Italian and was there during our stay and you can tell she loves what she's created and the people enjoy working there. Truly a magical experience.",Riad Kheirredine,Hotel,Marrakech
Fantasic. with a minor negative on AC.,"Just like the other reviewers said. The service is simply the BEST. The location is great. 15 mins walk from the Medina. Included breakfast was amazing. There is a reason this is ranked #1. So, the only negative, I would say was that A?C was not strong enough and needs to be updated. As it was July and we were at the top floor. it was getting very hot and wouldnt cool fast enough. Now this doesnt apply if you travel in non-summer. Other than that, I would go back there and stay there again. We were very happy with the hammam and Spa service. 
Thanks Elena and everyone else.",Riad Kheirredine,Hotel,Marrakech
A Hidden 5-Star Oasis in Marrakech,"What an absolute gem of a place to stay! I wasn’t sure what to expect at first, but from the moment we arrived, everything felt warm, welcoming, and effortlessly professional. An attendant from the riad kindly met us and guided us through the winding alleyways – already adding to the sense of mystery and adventure.

Then, as the door opened, we were completely taken aback – behind the unassuming entrance was the most stunning oasis, filled with beauty, charm, and smiling faces ready to greet us. A welcome drink on arrival set the tone – all class, without any pretence. I’ve stayed in many five-star hotels around the world, but this place truly holds its own.

The rooms were a dream – quiet and secluded, yet still just a short stroll from all the action, without a hint of the city noise. The food and hospitality were nothing short of exceptional, and the attention to detail – in the décor, the rooms, and the service – was outstanding.

We loved every moment. Having never stayed in a riad before, we didn’t know what to expect, but this experience surpassed every five-star hotel we’ve visited. If you’re heading to Marrakech, staying here is an absolute must!",Riad Kheirredine,Hotel,Marrakech
DA dream experience,"We stayed in this Riad with a couple of friends and immediately we were welcomed as a family, we arrived at nine in the morning after traveling at night and immediately although not included we were offered a wonderful breakfast, the staff is extremely present at all times of the day, ready to cuddle you and solve problems. Every time we went out on a hike, we were provided with a mobile phone where we could always be in touch with the hotel staff. Very clean room and typical and well-kept structure in the center of the Medina.
I recommend it wholeheartedly, never found such a welcome",Riad Kheirredine,Hotel,Marrakech
That's great!,"All fantastic!! You can't ask for more... from the staff you excellent data services, we will definitely come back to visit him!",Riad Kheirredine,Hotel,Marrakech
A perfect oasis in bustling Marrakesh. I would give it 6 stars if I could.,My wife and I just got back from a 4 night stay. This riad exceeded our expectations! We also booked a room for our newlywed daughter and son-in-law. The riad decorated their room with rose petals on the bed. The hotel is gorgeous in the traditional Moroccan style. It is immaculately clean. All of the staff were superbly attentive. Everyone spoke English. House keeping attended to the rooms twice daily with turn down service in the evening.  The food was excellent. Being July it was very hot. The rooftop restaurant after sunset was the perfect place to have dinner and enjoy the sounds of the  Medina in a relaxing breeze. The included breakfast is amazing. We took it in our room and at the indoor restaurant. The 3 crystal clear pools were inviting. We mostly spent our afternoons in the pool near the bar. The bartenders brought us drinks to the pool and never let our glasses empty. I fell in love with Moroccan tea and room service brought it to our room upon request at no additional charge. The included laundry service spoiled us. The spa was luxurious and the prices were half that of a spa in the United States. We had a couples hammam and couples massage 3 days in a row. We took two excursions while staying. Our balloon ride had a meeting point and a staff member happily walked us to the spot at 4:50am. We wanted a guide to show us the Medina and souk. The riad arranged everything and charged the tour to our room. We were so sad to have to leave.,Riad Kheirredine,Hotel,Marrakech
Amazing Honeymoon Experience,"We went for our Honeymoon and this was the most amazing Resort. The staff, the service, the accommodations, everything was amazing. The service at the pool was great, very attentive! The spa is so beautiful and this time of year is almost empty so was great for us and not over crowded.  Housekeeping and concierge also very attentive, we never waited more than 3 minutes for anything. The arrival and departure from the airport was also very seamless and the transportation is very luxurious. Truly a 5 star experience! We will be back!

"Could have been better in terms of cleanliness in room , storage and food choices.","We have been to five star hotels but this one is not five star . This is my experience and I feel staff is trained in such a way that they know which nationality they should be giving preference to.
Drinks were not that good. The only drink was perfect was their coffee from indore bar.
Welcome drink cups were stained all the way around and horrible sugary water. Apparently they were serving fresh orange juice as welcome drink aswell but to some special guest. As far as food is concerned it was not upto standard beside pasta and pizza.
If you carry on tipping every day then one might get some special favours. Just to make our stay comfortable we have to do that.
I agree with other guest rooms are small and cloth storage is not enough for two people sharing hence we left our cloths in suitcases to say the least for comfort.
Guest relation was helpful and manager at breakfast time provided good service.",Sol Oasis Marrakech,Hotel,Marrakech
Fantastic hotel,"We’ve just returned back home from a week at the Sol Oasis and we loved every minute of it. The majority of the reviews for this hotel are amazing and they are spot on. I can’t believe some of the recent lower rated reviews considering the experience I had here.

The food was incredible in my opinion, there were a lot of Moroccan foods in the buffet at lunch and dinner and I was excited to try all the different types of tagines that I could. Fussy eaters may struggle a little bit but my advice would be to just try as much as possible. If that fails, you can always go up the pizza oven by the bar and get a pizza. That was a great option to have throughout the days, from about 2pm til 10pm I think.

As for the drinks, on the most part they were great. One negative was that the same cocktail with one barman could taste completely different when ordered from the next barman, but we never had any that tasted bad. The cocktail list itself was decent and the bar staff will make you something that isn’t on the menu if you ask. There were 3 options for beer, Estrella, San Miguel and a local beer - all included in the AI. They are all bottled as they do not have draught beer. Soufiane and Nouredine deserve shout outs on the bar team.

The staff at this hotel are amazing, everyone was so friendly. The entertainment team as a whole are fantastic and they all take time out to get to know you and it’s genuine. Big shout outs to Khalil, Mohamed and Robio in particular who spoke with us often.

We got a massage in the spa which was good and cheap compared to the UK.

The rooms are slightly on the small side but the interior is great and overall we were very happy with the room.

The hotel is about 35/40 mins from the airport and about 30/35 mins to the medina. The hotel clearly states this and anyone who books the hotel should know this before booking, I don’t understand why people book this hotel and then complain about the location. The hotel provides a shuttle bus at multiple times during the day and this needs to be booked via the app but is very convenient and great to have. This is provided at check in.

Important to mention a couple of minor feedback points:
Drinks service at lunch and dinner was poor mostly, it’s fine if you want a soft drink or a glass of wine as they are left out for you to take as you want, but to get a beer at dinner wasn’t easy and nobody came over to us to offer one except for on one occasion.
Some sort of drinks service around the pool would be a great addition, I’m more than happy to walk to the bar for a drink but every so often the queues would be quite big so having that option would have been good.

I could go on and on listing the positives of this hotel but in conscious of the length of this review! The bottom line is if we decide to return to Marrakech, there is absolutely no doubt that it would be to the Sol Oasis.",Sol Oasis Marrakech,Hotel,Marrakech

My Honest Review of the Hotel,"My Honest Review of the Hotel

We arrived late on Saturday, but the reception staff welcomed us warmly and helped us with everything we needed. The next day, when we asked to change our room, they responded kindly and handled it with a smile.

The food was delicious, and the kitchen team did a great job. We really enjoyed trying new dishes.

The animation team was energetic and professional. They truly knew how to entertain guests and get everyone involved in the activities. Some of the team members who stood out were Jenna, Mo, Hamza, Mido, Zack, and Sam — they were all friendly, lively, and great at what they do.

This was my first trip to Morocco, and it was a good experience. If I have the chance, I would love to come back again.",Sol Oasis Marrakech,Hotel,Marrakech

Stunning Moroccan architecture and great Indian hospitality,"The architecture of the courtyard is stunning. You see a lot of great Moroccan architecture in the old city and the courtyard just brings you back there - but uber luxury style.

Excellent holiday,"One of the best hotels we have stayed at -beautiful setting , incredible design , very spacious . Not only that but the friendliness and efficiency of all  the staff  was incredibly good. Our room - Deluxe Villa with pool was one of the best we have stayed in - pool was excellent - big enough for swimming and a beautiful garden setting for relaxing. 

Grounds were beautifully kept and enjoyable for walking around- especially to see the rescue donkeys! Even managed a game of Petangue ! Spa was very spacious with a sizeable indoor pool and the treatments were excellent.

Reception were always freindly and helpful and the WhatsApp messaging system worked well. Concierge desk organised some trips for us which were most enjoyable.

We used all three restaurants and all were excellent .We lunched most days at Azure enjoying beautiful salads .Dinners at Rivayat were  excellent and we enjoyed the "" tasting "" menu with paired wine flights which were all well chosen .We loved the outdoor setting at Tamint - the views were mesmerising and the food was excellent but just the slightest criticism of the choices available- staying eight days , we had no menu changes although we were able to pre-order some dishes which were specially made. Thoroughly enjoyed the suggested Moroccan wines which were a very high standard.  Staff in all three restaurants were so friendly and efficient and clearly gave the impression that they wanted you to enjoy yourselves.

We will certainly return, wanting to explore the Atlas Mountains and more of Marrakech  and might come at a slightly cooler time of the year as the temperatures did rise up to the mid forties.",The Oberoi Marrakech,Hotel,Marrakech

Perfection at The Oberoi Marrakech.,"The breakfast buffet was diverse and delicious. The staff were not only helpful (they insisted to take my plate to my table for me while I continued to browse the selection) they informed us of and offered us local specialities including a local nut spread, tea, coffee and local breakfast breads.

We were celebrating my birthday and they upgraded us to a villa with a private pool decorated with rose petals, balloons and gifts. So many gifts!

The set menu at the indian restuarant was a culinary experience with lovely staff and beautiful (and tasty) food offerings.

Additionally we booked a hammam experience at the spa. Again, we were treated like royalty. No detail was left unattended. Thank you very much to the two ladies that attended to us - it was a unique and indulgent experience! And to all the staff - thank you for my generous birthday gift.

Every staff member we felt lucky to work with but a special mention for a few of them: Mamdouh Milad, Mahdi and Insaf were at the top of their game. Thank you so much for making our holiday to Marrakesh absolutely unforgettable!

Extra special mention to Zakaria... he took care of us for the majority of our time at the Oberoi. His humour and intelligence were a delight to accompany our meals and leisurely cocktail hours. Perhaps next time we can challenge you to that card game!

To everyone at the Oberoi - thank you so much for a delightful holiday with you.",The Oberoi Marrakech,Hotel,Marrakech
A relaxing stay with exceptionally warm service.,"I’ve been fortunate to have stayed at many premium hotels, and the Oberoi Marrakech truly stands out among the best for its genuine hospitality. 

Oberoi have created a beautiful, spacious & modern resort with lovely historic touches - the attention to detail in architecture of the main building a highlight. The grounds are sprawling with several enjoyable shaded pathways to explore. Aside from indoor and outdoor pools, there’s also a spa, a gym and a tennis court.

The service was excellent. From the warm welcome, the orientation of the hotel, and the countless staff who remembered my name after just one interaction. Managers were very hands on, always present and showed genuine warmth. Even the gardener discreetly moved aside when he noticed I was taking a photo of the grand canal - so thoughtful.

The Deluxe Villa with private pool was spacious, beautifully appointed and modern whilst retaining charming Moroccoan features. Housekeeping was excellent, but I did find one habit detracted a little from allowing me to feel more at home: each day, the villa was reset as though for new guests - informational signs placed back into prominent positions, rearranged toiletries, repositioned chairs.

Relaxing at the pool was very enjoyable, with loungers, day beds, and hammocks to choose from. One minor suggestion would be for the staff to check in more frequently - at best only two visits in six hours.

Breakfast offered both buffet and à la carte options. I’d highly recommend the shakshouka.  

Lunch at Azur was enjoyable, and I appreciated how allergy-friendly all the menus were throughout the property, as well as many common dietary requirements catered for by default. 

Dinner at Rivayat was exceptional. The tasting menu with wine pairings, the beautiful setting, and the fantastic DJ (Fri night) made for a memorable evening. 

Dinner at the other restaurant, Tamimt, was great - lighter fare but full of flavour. The vegetable tagine and pannacotta were tasty, and the live music (Sat night) and outdoor setting making for a very enjoyable evening.

My massage at the spa was very good. A minor suggestion would be for the kettle to be moved away from the relaxation area - its slow boil distracts from an otherwise serene space after the treatment. 

On a final note, I visited in July and the resort was very quiet. If you’re after a buzzier atmosphere, you might prefer a livelier season. The resort’s peaceful location is part of its charm and I found a 4-night stay the perfect duration, followed by a 3-night stay in the centre of Marrakech to take in the main sights and atmosphere of the city.",The Oberoi Marrakech,Hotel,Marrakech
An incredible stay,Incredible stay!! Beyond five star service. We Will return. We originally booked for 3 nights but had to extend by an extra day and book new flight.

An amazing experience,"The stay at The Oberoi, Marrakech was amazing, lived up to and beyond to our expectations. From the moment we entered the property to the moment we checked out, we were treated like family. 

Personal touch that made us feel genuinely welcomed and cared for. They were always attentive, checking in discreetly to ensure that every aspect of our stay was as comfortable as possible.

We visited Marrakech to celebrate my wife's birthday and it had been flawless. Our rooms were decorated, cakes and champagnes gifted. She was very happy. And therefore, a special shout out to the housekeeping team, who went above and beyond  to take care of our needs.

A Hidden Oasis in the Heart of Marrakesh – A Perfect Yoga Retreat,"From the moment we arrived at this stunning riad, we were completely enchanted. Tucked away from the bustling medina, it felt like stepping into a peaceful sanctuary – the perfect setting for a yoga retreat. The tranquility, beauty, and warmth of the space instantly put us at ease.

The staff were beyond wonderful – warm, attentive, and always going the extra mile to make us feel comfortable and cared for. Every single person we encountered radiated kindness and hospitality. We felt truly looked after throughout our stay.

The food was absolutely incredible – fresh, nourishing, and full of flavor. Every meal felt like it was prepared with love, and it was the perfect complement to our wellness-focused retreat.

The riad itself is a dream – beautifully designed with authentic Moroccan charm, lush courtyards, and calming spaces that made it easy to unwind. The spa was a real highlight too – the treatments were world-class, and the hammam was the ultimate indulgence.

I met some beautiful souls during our stay and left feeling grounded, inspired, and already planning our return. If you’re looking for a peaceful, rejuvenating experience in Marrakesh with heartfelt hospitality, look no further. I loved every moment and will definitely be coming back.",Riad le Clos des Arts,Hotel,Marrakech
Best Stay of My Life,"We had the best stay of our lives at Riad le Clos des Arts. The location is excellent in the medina. You are minutes away from 2 of the best palaces in Marrakech, and walking distance from everything in the medina. 

The riad itself is stunning. Photos do not do it justice. The staff are *incredible*. Valeria, Denise, Issam, Sadik and Zakaria were out of this world. They’re super helpful with recommendations, getting your bearings and generally making you feel like one of the family.

The rooftop is an oasis of beauty. There’s the dipping pool to escape the heat, the loungers for the sun. Breakfast in the sun, and dinner by moonlight.

The food at the riad is, without any hyperbole, the best in Marrakech. Fresh home made meals that blow your mind. You simply must take advantage of the hamam on-site too. You won’t regret it. In short, we’ve never stayed anywhere like this before and we will definitely be back!",Riad le Clos des Arts,Hotel,Marrakech
There aren't enough superlatives!,"If I could give this riad a 7, I would.....but we will have to settle for a gushing 5. 

The riad is a haven of peace and tranquility. The staff are superb and the hospitality, consideration and assistance are astounding. The owner said they treated the staff as family and it shows in everything they do. Guests are made to feel like family too. 

Located in the narrow, winding lanes of the Medina, it offers both seclusion from and access to everything you might want to see in Marrakech. The staff are happy to share their immense knowledge of the city and take time to meet and know their guests. They looked to ensure everything went well from the moment we flew in until we returned to the airport 

We dined at the hotel for three nights of our six nights, two of which felt like private dining. A different menu is published each day and the food was excellent. 

I could name names - pick out the aspects that made our stay an absolute pleasure, but that would be unfair to those behind the scenes whose names we never knew.

They well deserve their presence in the top tier of places to stay in Marrakech.",Riad le Clos des Arts,Hotel,Marrakech

An Ideal Marrakech Home Base – Full Riad Rental for a Family Celebration,"We just returned from a full week at Riad Clos des Arts, renting out the entire riad for our family, and had an excellent experience from start to finish. The staff was incredibly helpful even before we arrived.

Once we got there, the service was truly outstanding. Everyone was kind, attentive, and flexible with our schedule. They made everything feel easy and seamless, which let us focus on enjoying our time together. We especially appreciated the care and attentiveness of Sadek, Zachariah, Yaseen, and Valeria—each of them made a real effort to ensure we were comfortable and well looked after throughout the stay.

A highlight of the trip was the surprise 80th birthday celebration we planned for our dad. The team went above and beyond to help us pull it off and make it special. Their support and thoughtfulness really stood out and meant a lot to our whole family.

The riad itself is beautiful—thoughtfully designed and well maintained. The location couldn’t be better: tucked just steps away from the Medina, but remarkably quiet and peaceful. After exploring the city each day, the rooftop pool was a perfect place to cool down and relax.

We’re very grateful to the entire team at Riad Clos des Arts. Their professionalism, hospitality, and attention to detail made this a trip we’ll always remember. We’d gladly return and highly recommend it to anyone visiting Marrakech.",Riad le Clos des Arts,Hotel,Marrakech
Family time in Marrakech,"We had a multi-generational family gathering in Marrakech, and took the entire space at Riad Clos des Arts in Marrakech.  We found the facilities to be beautiful, and the staff attentive and helpful.  Rooms and common spaces were tastefully appointed well-equipped.  In particular, we appreciated the attentiveness of Sadek, Zachariah, Yaseen, and Valeria during our trip. They took the time to learn our names, and made us feel very welcome.  We celebrated an 80th birthday with dinner there, and the staff went above and beyond to make it a beautiful event;  we all enjoyed it so much!  The hotel is located on a quiet street off the medina.",Riad le Clos des Arts,Hotel,Marrakech
Above and Beyond,"There are not enough words to express how caring the Owner and staff are at this Riad.  The location is perfect and the room amazing, above expectations.  Unfortunately we were both pretty sick upon arrival with what turned out to be Bronchitis.  They arranged for a Dr. to come to the Riad and within hours we were on the way to recovery.  Along the way the Staff could not be more supportive or accommodating.",Riad le Clos des Arts,Hotel,Marrakech
Just perfection!,"My wife and I stayed here for four nights to celebrate her 40th birthday - our first trip away without the kids since we became parents. What can I say - the Clos Des Arts is just perfect. From the moment we walked in we were enchanted by the luxurious smell the charming Moroccan decor, and overall relaxed vibe of the place. 

When we arrived we were greeted by  Valeria in the square, and she escorted us to the riad where over mint tea, she gave us such a warm welcome and provided us with such a comprehensive breakdown of what we needed to know, places to go to, places to avoid, which online resources to use (maps.me really is excellent), we felt truly looked after from the get-go. Everyone at the riad are just so genuine, friendly and hospitable - I got to know them all by their first names, it felt like we were being looked after by a family. 

The riad itself is situated very close to Jema El-Fenaa (about a 5 - 7 min walk) but in spite of that, it's so quiet at the Clos Des Arts, you'd never guess you were right in the middle of it all.  

What makes this place so special and stand out from the rest for me, is the personal touch. My wife is vegan, and I could not find anything in the form of a cake that didn't have eggs or butter to get her for her birthday. When I asked Valeria for suggestions, she arranged for the house chef to make a special plant-based cake for my wife, at no extra cost! Also, as a Muslim I wanted to go to the Koutobia mosque to do Friday prayer but was concerned that my lack of Arabic language skills would mean that I was refused entry. Issam kindly gave me his very own prayer mat to take with me, to make sure that I fit right in and would gain access without any trouble at all. 

Our time there flew by so quickly, we wished we'd booked a few more days. If we ever go back to Marrakech without the kids, we're definitely going to stay here again - it's an absolute gem. A huge thank you to Valeria, Abdel, Zakaria, Issam, and Yassine (and everyone else) for making our stay there so special.",Riad le Clos des Arts,Hotel,Marrakech
An oasis of calm amidst the hustle and bustle of Marrakech Medina,"It was a wonderful experience to spend some days and nights in this exquisite Riad, which has been so thoughtfuly and beautifully designed and artistically decorated by its owners and managers, Valerie and Denise. From the careful induction meeting introducing us to the Riad and the Medina, to the delights of the in-house Hamman and the treat of eating breakfast and the occasional three course evening meal on the roof terrace, everything about our stay was exceptional. 

Located just a short walk from Jemaa el-Fnaa,  Marrakech's central square, theRiad is perfectly situated nearto all the man sights of the medina, and is a wonderful oasis of calm after the heat, hustle and the bustle of the tiny alleyways of the medina and the souk.

🌴🌴 Magical few days 🌴🌴,"Visited Dar Ayniwen earlier this week and it was superb in every way. 

Starting with our warm welcome from Aziz, who is like all staff committed to make your stay relaxing, attentive to your every need. 

The food is freshly prepared, generous portion size and delicious. 

The setting is idyllic and tranquil, and it’s feels like a stay in a beautiful family home. 

We headed out to the madness of the medina and soon retreated back to our oasis of calm, and enjoyed a wonderful relaxing massage. 

Our room Bambou was authentically decorated, was spotlessly clean and the bed was incredibly comfortable. 

You can do as much or as little as you want here. A 15-min ride to the city or stay put, swim, relax, play boules or table tennis, have a beer by the pool or find a shady spot to read a book. 

We will be back and would not hesitate in recommending the hotel. 

Thank you to everyone who made our stay so perfect.",Dar Ayniwen Hotel,Hotel,Marrakech

Spent the day in the main room with the fire lit playing cards and dominoes and let the house cast its spell on us as usual. Beautiful room and food, and wonderful staff. Sun came out for us for the rest of the stay, but now I know that the magic is Dar Ayniwen - not just the weather. Thanks again.",Dar Ayniwen Hotel,Hotel,Marrakech
A stylish oasis,"The hotel is a lovely green oasis in an area of sandy soil and palm trees north of Marrakesh, with most rooms in small buildings around the grounds.  We were upgraded to a suite (Tiwalin 1) which was very spacious and stylishly furnished.  Breakfast was served by the pool, and it was very good if a little unvarying - the yoghurt was delicious.  Whether the hotel is right for you or not depends on how you you want to spend your time.  It would be perfect for days in the sun by the pool, but we wanted to do sightseeing and this meant hiring taxis each day, which the hotel manager Aziz was very happy to arrange for us.  We had already stayed for 3 nights in a riad and wanted a change to some fresh air and green space.  We hadn't realised on booking that it was quite so far out of town, but it certainly gave us the relaxing outdoor space we were looking for.  We had a delicious dinner of fish/prawns on the second evening.  The problem was that the small number of diners made the atmosphere a bit awkward, and we didn't return on nights 3 and 4.  Overall a it was a luxurious and characterful hotel, with smiling and attentive staff, which we would be happy to recommend.",Dar Ayniwen Hotel,Hotel,Marrakech
Heavenly,"Still as heavenly as ever, a unique place in Marrakech lulled by birds in a park with lush vegetation…room and gastronomy at the top…
I recommend this place if you are looking for a place where you can immerse yourself after a colorful visit to the medina",Dar Ayniwen Hotel,Hotel,Marrakech
Paradise in the Palmeraie,"I am a little reluctant to write this as I would love to keep this exquisite place to myself… But equally, Dar Ayniwen thoroughly deserves a glowing review. 

The property is located in the Palmeraie, a palm grove to the east of Marrakech, dotted with boutique hotels and gated private homes. Upon arrival, after a short drive from the airport, I was warmly welcomed by manager Aziz and, fresh mint tea in hand, I was taken on a tour of the hotel’s beautiful gardens. I say ‘hotel’ - in fact staying at Dar Ayniwen feels more like being an honoured guest in a private home (which it once was.) An upgrade to the beautiful Tiwaline 1 suite awaited me - and what a room! Adorned with antiques and featuring a separate living room, a domed marble bathroom with walk-in shower and a supremely comfortable bed, it was truly a home from home. On the ground floor, at the side of the main house, Tiwaline 1 opens to a shady riad style garden complete with tortoises and a very vocal Siamese cat!

My 2 night stay was intended as a quiet period of relaxation prior to the arrival of a relative in Marrakech for some more energetic leisure pursuits. And it couldn’t have been more perfect. A comfortable sun lounger was placed in the spot of my choosing on the expansive lawn near the (heated but still refreshing) pool for an afternoon of much needed sun. (26 degrees was an absolute joy after cold, grey late January England!) When I brought a soft drink from the fridge in my room, a glass was delivered with a little table. This is just one example of how the (superb) staff strike just the right balance - attentive but unobtrusive. And as a solo traveller and first time visitor to Morocco, I felt thoroughly looked after.

Meals are taken in a charming, cosy tent with an open fire. (There’s a terrace for balmier evenings). Breakfast is a tasty combination of fruit, pastries and Moroccan pancakes, brought to your table. Dinner - ordered in advance to ensure the freshest ingredients can be sourced on the day - was honestly the best food I have eaten in a hotel. The beef tagine was utterly sublime. On my first evening I was welcomed into the tent by owner Stéphane. Merci/shukran Stéphane for sharing your family home with your guests!

For a treat I had booked a spa treatment, but Amina, the hotel’s beautician, was unwell on the day I had booked, so the hotel arranged a transfer for me to and from a local hammam and spa about 10 minutes away, which I found via google. (I hope Amina is much better now.) 

After two blissful nights cocooned in this peaceful paradise, I left Dar Ayniwen feeling relaxed, refreshed and ready to take on whatever Marrakech had to offer! 

Thank you to Stéphane, Aziz, Ismael, Rashid and everyone who works so hard to make Dar Ayniwen such a welcoming place. They have truly nailed 5 star service in a boutique setting. I shall most certainly return!",Dar Ayniwen Hotel,Hotel,Marrakech
Heavenly,"A magnificent hotel, high-class welcome and service, all in a warm and friendly atmosphere. The owner is very attentive, the staff very discreet and attentive to the smallest details. The rooms are superb, very well equipped, with heating, important in this season! There is a lot of green space, magnificent aviaries and in addition private terraces in front of each accommodation, privatization and calm. All meals are delicious and plentiful.
A special thank you to Rachid and the chef.
Thank you very much to Aziz, for his availability, kindness and professionalism.
We highly recommend this hotel, as a family, as a couple or alone.
We will come back, for sure!!",Dar Ayniwen Hotel,Hotel,Marrakech
A magical stay!,"We have just spent 4 nights in this intimate hotel nestled in a magnificent green setting conducive to rest and serenity.

The suite is very pleasant, tastefully decorated, the service impeccable, thanks to Aziz for this valuable advice and the table in the evening a delight!

High quality hotel expertise.

We will come back, that’s undeniable.",Dar Ayniwen Hotel,Hotel,Marrakech
Relaxing paradise,"This hotel is absolutely breathtaking. It exceeded our expectations for a peaceful getaway. The entire hotel is surrounded by gardens that you can explore, a beautiful pool and main house but to be honest for us the highlight was the staff and the chef!!! The food here was incredible!! If you’re looking for a more private getaway right outside of the city this is the place. There were also drivers available to be arranged at all times to go into the city or anywhere which was perfect for us. Aziz also made sure to give us all the best recommendations!!! Thank you again for such an incredible stay! ",Dar Ayniwen Hotel,Hotel,Marrakech
"convenient 1 km from the square , if you arrive late at night , do not be scared -","We arrived in Marrakech around midnight and I have to say that passing through the dirty, smoky alleys with strange people, the first approach was not the best. The riad is not exactly luxury and the area not really Dubai Marina:-) .BUT, never be fooled by the first impression. the next day with the sun and clean alleys looked better and with time we enjoyed the place than the people. The Moroccans, I must say, are very hospitable and not intrusive, I really liked them, and they are not the ones who come here to criminalize, it is good that you can not consume alcohol, otherwise there would be 200 accidents an hour seen how they run with mopeds through the alleys. That said, the riad has a good service, great breakfast the rooms are appreciable, not really new and perfect, but you always have to consider the cost and where we are. Would I go back? Yeah, maybe I'd try alternatives.",Riad Ben Tachfine,Hotel,Marrakech
A place to meet,The place allows you to fully grasp the spirit of Marrakech. Ahmed and Achraf are hosts of rare kindness and helpfulness. The structure is charming and quiet. Good quality breakfast. I suggest trying the Hammam experience,Riad Ben Tachfine,Hotel,Marrakech
An oasis of calm away from the bustling streets of Marrakech's Medina,"From Ahamed first meeting our Taxi on the street, to his welcoming Mint Tea, to his farewell, we felt well looked after by him and the team at Riad Ben Tachfine.
Easy to get to by taxi or bus followed by a short walk the Riad is set within a warren of alleys just off a bustling market street in the Medina.
It maybe cliché however it was truly an oasis of calm away from the bustling streets. Set on 3 levels it comprises 6 rooms and all appeared to be decorated in the local fashion with local furniture. Ours was spacious enough and there were plenty of other areas, within the riad, that could be utilised to sit and read or chat. The one we utilised the most was the roof terrace and ‘crows nest’ above.
The breakfast was predominately bread based, in a variety of forms along with an omelette and juice, which we devoured each morning. An evening menu was available however would need to be ordered in advance.
We decided to book the ‘in house’ Hammam and again were not disappointed with the experience
The staff were available 24 / 7 and we were always met with a smile no matter the time, or the request. Nothing was too much trouble, from the advice offered to the service received and we felt well looked after during our stay.
We would highly recommend Riad Ben Tachfine. A great location offering a quiet and relaxing place to stay after experiencing the hectic streets of Marrakech, with a welcoming and informative host!",Riad Ben Tachfine,Hotel,Marrakech
A lovely stay and great location,"A great location. Walls are very thin so you hear everything and especially when people sit up in the riad or it’s windy and the roof covering is being blown over. If you’re a light sleeper you could find this hard. The host was wonderful and very caring and gave us great advice and tips and took time to go through everything with us. Room was clean, though the hairdryer provided blew the electricity and we didn’t get it back for a while! Plenty of hot water and the breakfast is a good start to the day, but a bit of fruit would be nice with it. It’s a very useful stay when you want to be close to everything and we felt very safe walking around the area at any time of day or night.",Riad Ben Tachfine,Hotel,Marrakech
Enchanted parenthesis,"We spent a weekend with friends.
It was an enchanted parenthesis. We were made so welcome. Everything was perfect. Massages, meals, breakfast, decoration...
Our hosts took great care of us.
We had a heavy heart to leave... but we will come back, for sure...",Riad Ben Tachfine,Hotel,Marrakech
A Hidden Gem,"The Riad is beautiful and well
appointed. Our room was clean and comfortable and it was lovely to take breakfast each morning on the open air terrace. We also enjoyed a delicious traditional meal on our first night. The staff - Muhammad, Mehmet and Asharaf and the rest of the team were exceptional and simply couldn't do enough for us - providing safety advice and tourist guidance as well as organising transfer to and from the airport. They are a great example of the graciousness and welcoming nature of the Moroccan people.

The Riad is deep in the alleyways
behind the souks and it can be daunting coming back at night in the dark. But the staff are in hand to provide advice and conducted us from our transfer taxi in our first night. We personally did not experience any problems on our way to and from the Riad at any time.",Riad Ben Tachfine,Hotel,Marrakech
Oasis In The “Desert” Of Marrakech,"Riad located in the food souk area in the ""upper part"" of the medina (15 minutes from Jemaa El Fna square) in a strategic position to visit Marrakech but at the same time far from the chaos and noise of the city;
The staff is superb, Ashraf's welcome and his availability in advising us where to go and giving us all the necessary recommendations every time we ventured to Marrakech was like that of a ""family man"" and made us feel right from the start. first minute as if we were at home within a family.
The riad is clean and well organised, the rooms are welcoming and have everything you need to have a pleasant stay; The kitchen offers typical Moroccan dishes and I must say after trying it a couple of evenings that it proved to be very good with the quality of the fresh and excellent quality raw materials.
Hygiene and cleanliness are higher than Moroccan standards.
Excellent value for money.
Thanks to Ashraf and the other collaborators for ""hosting"" us and making our trip to Morocco an even more beautiful experience.",Riad Ben Tachfine,Hotel,Marrakech
Horrible/terrible location but the riad itself is 10/10,"Okay so imma break into 2 the riad is 10/10 lovely ppl that work there very accommodating, excellent customer service. The riad itself is nice but it’s old so my shower and sink kept clogging. Stunning rooms and amazing breakfast however the location is terrible it’s behind the market and it’s an alleyway so at nighttime if you are just female travellers it’s very scary and the men kept starting and cat calling us at times. I didn’t feel comfortable at this location. We stayed in some nights because we didn’t want to walk through the alleyways at 2am 3am or 4am in the morning. The only way to get to this riad is through the alleyways the taxi can only drop you on the main road than you have walk 3-5 minutes down the market and alleyways to get to the riad, not to mention market smells so bad, they sell anything from fish/meat/clothes so you end up taking all that back to the riad. I didn’t feel like I was on holiday so we moved places after 2 nights. The riad itself is good vibes I loved it there but I don’t want to feel like a prisoner on holiday due to the location so we dipped. Didn’t get refund or even 30% back even though we stayed 2 night out of 7 nights. I was not happy with that at all.",Riad Ben Tachfine,Hotel,Marrakech
Not recommended!,"Not recommended!
We booked because the comments were good. I cannot understand it. We arrived in the night at 22.00.
Tha taxi driver asked them to come some meters to pick us up, but they didn t do it. No light on the street, we found finally the riad, the location is in a very poor primitive area, very dirty, lot a sick cats (with crying small baby s), not a pleasant experience to walk to the place. At night it’s very unsafe with beggars on the street. 
Inside, not clean (as my husband want to take a shower, the drainage was not working, a lot of hair floated on the water).
At breakfast on the day, were 2 tables, one was sitting the ownerfamily and at the second one a gast. The another gast was standig up to give us the table. My chair was broken, as the owner saw it, he gived me his chair, and told me, that he makes allways good things 😂.
So.., ( even if we already paid  for the 6 nights) we took the luggages and changed the riad. 
So, this was our experience...",Riad Ben Tachfine,Hotel,Marrakech
Lovely riad and lovely service,Myself and my family stayed here and had a lovely nights stay. We were welcomed by Ibrihim who helped us with our bags. Malika cooked us an amazing dinner and we also had a lovely breakfast. Great service,Riad Ben Tachfine,Hotel,Marrakech
Brilliant hotel,"We just got back and it was an amazing experience. I have never felt safer in a hotel. The hotel deserves its 5stars rating, it is beautifully done, luxurious and extremely clean. Our room was stunning, the pool always had loungers available, food was brilliant and staff were very friendly. The easiest 5star review ever!",Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Hotel,Marrakech
Amazing Amazing experience!,"This was my second visit to the Be Live Collection Adults Only Resort, and it somehow managed to surpass my already high expectations from the first time. I had an incredible trip with my friends, and much of that was thanks to the exceptional staff who made our stay truly memorable.

A special thank you goes to Manager Mouhia and Kaoutar from Public Relations. Their warm, helpful approach made a real difference. Kaoutar, in particular, went above and beyond—when we had trouble reaching our external transfer company, she took it upon herself to track them down and ensure everything was sorted. Her dedication and professionalism were outstanding.

The indoor bar staff were also fantastic, especially the evening shift manager, who made every evening feel special. I’d also like to give a heartfelt shoutout to Momo from the pool team, who consistently went the extra mile to make our swimming experience enjoyable and relaxing.

Overall, the service at Be Live was exceptional across the board. I’ve stayed at other five-star resorts in places like Dubai, Turkey, and Qatar, but none have matched the level of care and hospitality I experienced here. We’re already planning our next visit!",Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Hotel,Marrakech
Amazing Place and Experience,"The experience here was amazing, truly brilliant and worth a visit to stay. Madame Mounia, the Quality Manager is an outstanding manager. She is so welcoming, approachable, lovely and caring. She treated us like family and not just guest. She was always smilimg, asking us if we were ok and if we need help. That is something you want when you go on holiday, to feel welcomed and loved.

She has an amazing team who are really friendly and always serve with a smile.kaoutar and ghizlane ard the best.",Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Hotel,Marrakech
Fantastic Holiday Vibes,"The daytime entertainment was absolutely fantastic! There were so many fun activities around the pool like water polo, ping-pong, and darts , we were never bored. A huge thank you to Mo for his incredible energy and talent. He made every moment so enjoyable and truly turned our holiday into an unforgettable experience.",Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Hotel,Marrakech
A memorable holiday,"This hotel was spotlessly clean and the staff were very friendly and went out of their way to help you. We stopped in the swim up room which was a godsend in the 40+ degree temperatures. We had an iron and board, tv with a couple of English channels on, tea and coffee making facilities, bathrobes and slippers, free safe and a fridge which was stocked daily with little milk cups and a 2lt bottle of water daily. The wifi was excellent (they were having issues with WiFi externally) and the air con was great. We loved the large shower too. We had little ammeties in the bathroom. A couple of minor letdown were the bees around the snackbar and the lack of speed getting served  and the food was a little limited also. Having said that it was tasty 😋 but if your a picky eater you will struggle with the choice. Thank you for a wonderful holiday to all the staff there 😀 ps we named the little kitten Tiger 😀",Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Hotel,Marrakech
4 star,"Arrived and greeted with Moroccan tea . Porter took our bags . We had a swim up room very spacious and clean beds very comfy . Son had a sole room and it was fabulous for him . Mini fridge in room which was stocked up each day with one large bottle of water . Iron and ironing board in swim up room which. Safe which was free to use . Our air conditioning wasn’t great whereas as sons was really good . We had a bath and shower but could only use the bath water if we filled it up with the shower head . TV didn’t have many English channels apart from 2 . 2 pools one quiet with swim up bar , this pool is lovely but does need a little tlc . The guests spoil it sometime as they leave empty glasses all round the pool side and this attracts the bees which are everywhere as it is . The louder pool was actually cleaner looking but I do not put this down to staff but to the guests returning the glasses . Bees are a problem around the snack bar area especially and my husband was stung . I don’t know if there were epi pens if he had a reaction but I’m glad we didn’t need to find out . Restaurant food is plentiful and so much choice I really don’t understand people saying there isn’t choice . Staff all pleasant especially zizu in lobby bar and the 2 ladies on the snack bar . We had new bath towels everyday and new dressing gowns too . The pool staff are attentive and if they see you struggling with the umbrellas they help straight away . The entertainment team work hard but we don’t get involved as our holidays are for relaxing we do enough at home ! One thing is that you can only have 2 drinks at a time so you have to make journeys together if you want to get drinks for all family and there was always a queue . This was my big gripe as I saw some staff giving the holiday makers 4 at a time then refusing the next person . This happened on our last day but one when one guest asked for 4 drinks and as refused then sad they had been there 12 days already and they had never refused before she got her 4 drinks but I only had 2 . This is where it needs to be consistent and fair to all . The gardens are kept immaculate and the garden team work extremely hard and probably don’t get the credit they deserve . Evening entertainment was ok nothing special but sitting in the lovely lobby bar was very nice . There is a resident hotel cat and another 2 cats on hotel grounds one being a small kitten . I grew very attached to the kitten and I really hope that the hotel staff look after them . I did feed them every day . I would definitely go back . What i would change is have more sport on in sports bar, get more staff to help on the snack bar, try to reduce the amount of bees, allow the guests to have more than 2 drinks per visit to bar or bigger glasses . Introduce sparkling wine, more up to date entertainment on evening and rota every 2 weeks and a better toaster in the main restaurant. Big big shout out to the pasta station the food was incredible. All in all we had a fab 2 weeks holiday . Thank you",Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Hotel,Marrakech

Unforgettable honeymoon with great food and amazing staff!,"We had a fantastic honeymoon here. If you're looking for an all-inclusive right in the middle of a city, this is the place to go. You'll be pampered by all the staff, fun activities are organized, the food is amazing, and the staff are incredibly friendly.

And if you want the best cocktails, make sure to visit Hamza and Abderahmane. Wow, such great guys and their cocktails are truly the best in the resort!

Thank you to everyone at TUI Medina Gardens for an unforgettable week.",TUI BLUE Medina Gardens,Hotel,Marrakech
Shocking decline in the space of 12 months,"We came back to Medina gardens for the second year in a row, having had such an amazing time last year. The 2 experiences couldn’t have been further apart. 

The air conditioning in the room was all but useless, even after having it on all night the temperate was still 21-22 degrees, with 40 degree plus heat outside it was extremely uncomfortable and difficult to sleep. We spoke to reception, someone came to clean the filter, which was absolutely filthy, but it made no difference. 

We purchased day beds so we could have some shade. On the Sunday, the beds by the main pool were all booked so we booked a bed by the relax pool. When we got to the bed, not only was it completely broken but there were no cushions on it. The bed was broken in the middle so both sides tilted towards the middle, the back section was completely broken off so we had nothing to lean up against. When we spoke to the lifeguard and asked for some cushions, he told us they were in the laundry. 

Upon check out we told the receptionist we didn’t use the bed on Sunday and asked them to remove it. I then had to wait over 30 mins on our last day for the manager to seek out the lifeguard and ask him. She then came back and told me they could not remove it from my charge as we didn’t let them know on the day and that it had already been charged to my room. We had booked a bed for the final day, so I asked if that could be refunded, the manager agreed, I paid the bill. 

Twenty minutes later the same manager came out to the pool to our bed and told me we had to pay for the bed! I refused. 

Service in the main restaurant was slow and poor, as was the food. 

We paid for a jacuzzi for our balcony; hardly any of the jets worked, the plastic surround was tatty and dirty, we only used it once. 

The WiFi was shocking. At least 50% of our stay we had none. It kept going in and out which was frustrating when you’re trying to listen to music or an audiobook by the pool. 

The resort wreaks of cost cutting and is no longer a premium facility. 

The only positive was the service of the guys making cocktails in ‘the bar’ they were brilliant, so friendly and excellent service. 

Needless to say we will not be returning next year.",TUI BLUE Medina Gardens,Hotel,Marrakech
"Beautiful, clean, friendly hotel.",Third time here but first time during Summer as usually come for New Year's Eve. Staff are friendly and helpful. They really do want you to enjoy your time. Food is excellent with great selection and very fresh. I did email hotel 3 times over a 4 month period before arriving in order to request room upgrade but never had response. Our room experience has got worse each time we come here.  Another thing to note is we asked for late check out and paid for this but was only given one option till 6pm. When looking on app we saw we could have checked out 2 hours earlier (which fitted with our flight) and it would have been cheaper. We did tell reception and they apologised. Entertainment staff seem to be enjoying themselves but could have done more to involve people during Entertainment nights. We feel this was much better at new year.  There is unfortunately the same age old issue of the reserving sunbeds at crack of dawn which is a pain and have seen this done so much better at other hotels with app reservations etc. The one morning that the sunbed policy was followed through was much better to avoid the sunbed hoggers who leave the towel and disappear back to bed etc.  Overall this is a beautiful hotel with very hard working friendly staff and we will most likely return again in the future.,TUI BLUE Medina Gardens,Hotel,Marrakech
An amazing two weeks away.,"Just back from our fourth stay here and it just gets better each year. 
Hotel is in a perfect position for exploring the souks and riads and a very short taxi ride to some of Marrakech’s best spots such as plus61 restaurant or Al Fassia Aguedal. 

We knew that there had been a change of manager this year and with that some staff changes, so wondered if it would have the same family ran feeling, but there were no issues at all. In fact the whole team were incredible. 
From Chef Said and his hard working squad delivering amazing quality hotel food (wait til you see the desserts!) to Aazzedine and Fatima 🥰 looking after us superbly. They have all been here years now and are an example to all in terms of service, politeness and friendliness. 
I swam every morning and called in to the restaurant for a coffee before going back to the room and the daily greeting from Abdullah is worth coming back here alone. Top top guy. 
Moroccan hospitality takes some beating, and this goes for outside of the hotel environment too, but if this hotel lacks in any 5star refinery then it’s made up for in spades by the people. 
From the warm welcome by Abir, Chawki and the management team after a late arrival, to the great service by the pool bar squad including Abdulwahid and Reda, topped off by the best bar staff in the city in Ahmed, Mohamed and Omar. 
There have been changes to the nightly entertainment, not something we’re huge on, but definitely better, and overall lots of little improvements around the whole hotel which are noticeable. There are even a peacock and hen wandering the superbly kept gardens now, which is a strange sight at first but really adds to the character of the place. 
Padel courts, a heated quiet pool for laps and a great gym keeps you in cake credit (you’ll need it), but if you just want to come away to switch off, enjoy some glorious uninterrupted sunshine with only a 15 minute airport transfer then this is the spot. ( RAK airport was great this year too, so it looks like they have addressed the queuing complaints)
There are so many amazing places to visit in the city and using Medina Gardens as a base is perfect. 
Trips to the secret garden, El Fenn, Kabana, Nobu are all within walking distance and Majorelle area with shops and museums is a 5 minute taxi trip.  Just beware of using InDrive as an uber alternative. Some of the drivers are lunatics! Better to pay the local taxis a bit more for a safer, more enjoyable trip. 
Not sure there’s much more to add and sorry if I’ve missed anyone out but I’m really struggling to think of anything negative to say. 
I miss lazing in the pool with the city sounds and the call to prayer floating over the garden walls. 
My wife and I will definitely be returning a fifth time.",TUI BLUE Medina Gardens,Hotel,Marrakech
Another Excellent Stay,"This hotel is serene relaxing and stress free with immaculate grounds comfortable and clean rooms and beautiful sunshine. The hotel is in a great location to explore Marrakech.
My husband and I have recently returned from our third visit to Medina Gardens and it continues to amaze me how in the middle of a city the beautiful gardens and the hotel are so peaceful and relaxing. Both pools are of a temperature that you can get straight in and swim and are of a size that they do not get overcrowded.
The restaurant serves a variety of different foods and they are not the same every night as there are different themes.  The head chef Said serves up delectable delights every night and would give Gordon Ramsey a run for his money.
All the staff are amazing and cannot do enough for you to make your stay memorable.  The pool bar staff led by Mustafa and assisted by cheeky boy Reda, Bada and Omar are contantly walking around the hotel grounds with drinks for the guests and they also remember your favourite tipple.  The restaurant servers Fatima and Armin are quick to fill your drinks glass and clear your table and are friendly polite and professional and nothing is too much trouble for them. Abdula the restaurant cleaner is constantly on the go keeping the restaurant clean and hygeinic.  The restaurant manager Chawki who is new to the hotel and had only joined the staff 2 days before we arrived goes above and beyond with his excellent hospitality. The reception I only visited to change currency and the staff member Moad was extreamly helpful and engaging.
The Tui rep Zenib is very knowledly if you have any questions about places to visit and she does not just sell trips if they are not  suitable and she is always on site at the time her notice states.  And last but not least the owner of the hotel Hassan who also comes on site most days and speaks to the quests to make sure eveything is going well.  The hotel has 24 hour security and the head guard Hassan keeps everyone safe.
I have travelled to many countries and only once in Thailand returned to the same hotel, but for a short flight, a beautiful hotel and grounds, relaxation, excellent food, amazing staff this for me is a hotel I can visit time and time again. We will be back for a forth visit",TUI BLUE Medina Gardens,Hotel,Marrakech
Good Stay At TUI BLUE Medina Gardens,"My wife & I have just returned from a two week stay at TUI BLUE Medina Gardens. Flying time was three hours five minutes from Bristol and Transfer time to the hotel was twenty minutes or so. We arrived at 21:30 but the restaurant remained open for our evening meal. During check-in you are fitted with your AI wristband.
 
We booked a jacuzzi room and were shown to room 2004.  The bed was large and comfortable - air conditioning worked well and was not noisy. Sleep quality was good although we heard loud music 01:20 one morning but didn't know the source.  Room servicing by the household staff was excellent!    I requested extra coat hangers via the Tui blue app - you can make maintenance and housekeeping requests via the app.
 
Wi-Fi - this was free and good within the hotel buildings but was patchy in the garden area.

Money exchange - change your GB pounds to Dirams in reception - we got and exchange rate of 11.8 to the pound. Don't take Dirams home - it's a closed currency. There is a charity box at the airport .

Pools - we used the quiet pool or the surrounding garden area during our our stay as the main pool was loud and busy.  Reserving of sunbeds is supposed to be against the rules but everyone did it.   Depth was 1.5M all areas .Get pool towels from the towel hut with your blue card.  Towels can be well used but are okay.

There is no drinks service at the quiet pool - you need to walk to the main pool bar for drinks or coffee. Nearest toilets were behind the Culinarium restaurant.

Food - we booked one evening meal at the Culinarium via the Tui Blue App - It wouldn't let us book again during our second week as it says one booking only via the app. We found the Culinarium okay but didn't worry about visiting again as we thought the main restaurant was much better for variety. We didn't use the Culinarium lunchtime for the same reason.

The Restaurant is the main place we ate all our meals - Breakfast was very good for choice with live cooking stations for eggs / omelettes etc. Staff were quick to serve Tea or coffee and clearing the used plates . Juices and various fruits available.

Evening meals at The Restaurant are themed - International , Moroccan,  Indian and seafood to name a few. No dress code is in operation here. Choices again are wide and varied. Fish was always available usually at the live cooking stations- The tagines were always worth a look as they contained meats , fish or vegetables cooked with preserved lemons.   Staff serving wines and water were prompt to ask you what you wanted to drink - All the wines including red, rose ,white and Prosecco were very drinkable.  Bottled or draught beer was good too. There was live music, violin and Moroccan, here some evenings too which was nice to listen to as you ate your meal.

Bar - the main bar and the Piano bar are nice and air conditioned, ( lovely when outside it was 40 degrees) although the piano person only appeared a couple of times a week we really enjoyed listening to him .  Service was good here as were the gin & tonics. AI Cocktails are available - the Pina coladas were very nice.

Entertainment - some nights a quiz or musical bingo was available at 21:00 before the main show at 21:45 in the fountain bar. These acts were mostly good. Bar service was ok. Shows include Moroccan show, live music or live act with belly dancers with fire!

Tours - we booked the 09:30 half day historical tour costing approx £30 each - this included a guide and coach - we visited the mosque you see and hear from the hotel (not inside) - we were then taken to the rear of our hotel (dropped behind the wall at the back of the Padel court to continue on foot)  We then walked through the arch across the road to enter the souks (no stopping to look at the stalls)  to visit  Medersa Ben Youssef Marrakech, a historic Islamic school located in the heart of Marrakech and the Bahia Palace. We walked 5.1 miles in total in the heat of Marrakech, so would not recommend if you have mobility issues.  The coach returned us at 12:30 approx - value 5/10.

Checkout - our hotel pick-up was 17:35  - we asked for a late checkout and this was granted at no cost.  

 There are tip boxes in in reception to tip the various departments.
 
We enjoyed our stay at TUI BLUE Medina Gardens and would recommend it as a destination for your stay.

I hope you find my review helpful!",TUI BLUE Medina Gardens,Hotel,Marrakech
Beautiful and Relaxing Stay,"This hotel is one of the best hotels I have stayed in. If you're looking for a relaxing stress free holiday this is the hotel for you.
Rooms- Very comfortable beds and all the essentials you need. Cleanliness is excellent.

Gardens/Pools- Perfect. There is something for everyone. Busy main pool but still relaxing. Private and relaxing garden spaces to sunbathe in and a lovely relax pool. The hotel was full capacity and there are no sunbed wars unless you specifically want a certain bed, however that is your choice and there are always plenty of beds available in the beautiful garden areas which I preferred as they had natural shade under the lovely garden trees. 

Restaurant- Could not have asked for more. The main buffet restaurant (the only one we use on our 4nts stay) was faultless. The food was varied and very tasty. Plenty of choice for everyone. What I appreciated the most though after staying in numerous AI hotels is that this one did not have the over busy canteen feel, it is an oasis of relaxation. I can not explain enough how relaxing meal times was at this hotel compared to other AI hotels I have stayed in.

Staff- Amazing!! All of them. I can not name just one, they were all as friendly and helpful as each other and this is the first time I have experienced this in a hotel. They are so helpful and always have a smile on their face despite how busy. They work long hours in high heat and I never heard anyone complain. They are a true credit to this hotel. 

Gardens- Beautiful. The resident cats I loved (as a cat lover) to fellow cat lovers that have stayed here mum cat is doing well and her kittens, saw the staff feed them and they truly do look after the animals there which I appreciated.

Entertainment- The usual AI entertainment which was pretty good. The Moroccan night was a highlight.

Spa- A friend and myself visited and the massage was amazing. The price is very reasonable and the staff were so friendly and accommodating. I would highly recommend a visit.

If you stay here you will not be disappointed. Proximity to Marrakesh is perfect. The staff are all amazing and friendly. Not once did I feel the need to tip all the time, it mode no difference to the experience I received and in turn I made sure that I tipped well in the very convenient tip box for all staff in the reception area. This made the whole tipping process so much more easier and relaxing and to be honest all hotels should adopt this practice, as I am sure people tip much better this was if they do not feel harassed to do so. Please if you stay here tip generously at the end of your stay using this method as all the staff here deserve praise.

I stayed here with friends but will definitely be back soon with my husband who will absolutely love this hotel.",TUI BLUE Medina Gardens,Hotel,Marrakech
Exelent,A charming and serene spot hidden within the hustle of Marrakech. The garden is beautifully maintained with vibrant colors and traditional decor. A great place to relax and take in the atmosphere. Perfect for photos and a short break from the busy souks.,TUI BLUE Medina Gardens,Hotel,Marrakech
The best holiday for Peace & Tranquility,"Very quick through airport & leaving on the bus within 30 mins, very impressed with this hotel as soon as we walked in, we were led to seats with mint tea offered before being given our room allocation.
The restaurant was left open for us to eat which was lovely after all the travelling 

On our first night we initially had problems with the air conditioning not working, it took 3 phone calls and 2 visits to reception and nothing was sorted. We spent our first full morning trying to sort it out & It took me eventually going to our tui rep who immediately jumped in and offered another room which we accepted, they were amazing both Abir & Zineb very patient with us. It wasn't fun having to repack and move everything but we were so grateful in having air conditioning the rest of the week.
The hotel is absolutely stunning, we loved the gardens and spent most of our time there as it was slightly cooler that the main pool but we used both pools for swimming, no problems getting a sunbed at any time of day. 

Wifi very good - usually get an esim but wasn't needed this time
We ate every day at the restaurant, food was nice and a good variety, our waiter yasine was very efficient and friendly, we really enjoyed getting to know him over the course of the week and nothing was too much trouble for him. 

We dont drink alcohol but soft drinks all from a bottle and quite lukewarm, a pump tap would've been much better for both staff and guests but we did get ice cold still & sparkling water from the machine. 

We did some of the classes with Laura, she is wonderful really put us at ease and was great with the classes. We had no plans to go to the medina square as we were honestly really anxious about it, she really encouraged us to go even just to walk around and gave us lots of tips and we ended up going, she needs a medal for that 😂
We also had a lovely massage, absolutely incredible experience.
Overall this place is all about peace and tranquility with still lots going on, I've never been to the same place twice but I will definitely be returning here and recommending to other friends.
Best holiday I've ever had ❤️ 

Some niggly bits 
The partition wall between the bedroom & shower needs more privacy, for those staying who are not couples it can be a bit awkward having to undress to get in the shower.
Needs more hooks in the room as there was absolutely nowhere to hang any towels or anything.
Mealtimes constantly having to ask for bowls and spoons as they are not on the table
Shower tray needs some antislip on the gloss white tray so slippery",TUI BLUE Medina Gardens,Hotel,Marrakech
Some like it HOT! Moroccan magic...,"Probably best to start with what's great about this characterful place:
- general vibe. Chilled, no pressure to do anything. If you want/need a place to just 'splat' then you got it. Hearing the daily calls to prayer from within the hotel was fascinating and reminded you where you were -  in the heart of a bustling North African city which is right on your doorstep if you want to explore
- mostly extremely pleasant, friendly staff who clearly work very hard and put in the hours to look after both the customers and the hotel itself. The gardens are lovely with real points of interest and the pool is clean and well kept. 
- the food is great, and I like that if you want 'UK' food (which you really shouldn't whilst here) it's lunchtimes only for chips! 
What could be better...:
- Rooms are a bit tired. Hit with the smell of stale cigarette smoke upon entry. And bits just periodically fell off during our stay - the patio lock, the door lock, the shaving mirror landing in my hand. Our shower door didn't work properly and the handle was covered in limescale. The safe deciding it wasn't letting us in. Minor gripes but expected a bit better. Also, unless you're with your true love, there's not much in the way of privacy with the bathroom being quite exposed to the bedroom area. Towels could do with a refresh, as well, they were quite rough and threadbare. 
- The bar service overall was pretty good, if you're not in a hurry. But the inconsistency in what you asked for (unless it was wine or beer), was quite dramatic. Some times mindblowingly strong cocktails and others had us questioning if there was any alcohol in them. And the pool bar staff were almost mute in their interactions - at least with me. To be fair, I think I'd be a bit naffed off if all carbonated drinks had to be served from plastic or glass bottles and not on tap. Come on TUI, this is a busy hotel, you can't expect staff to serve drinks like they're at a kids' party! Same for the restaurant area. The poor servers have tiny little workstations - no wonder there were a few spectacular crash/tinkles.
Overall, however, it's a lovely hotel, with some fun - but not too full on - entertainment, and quiet spots for those that want it. Add on the Lionesses winning whilst we were there which turned the Fountain Bar into an impromptu jamboree venue and would I recommend this place to friends and family? Yes!",TUI BLUE Medina Gardens,Hotel,Marrakech
"Fantastic Food, Disappointing Drinks!","We’ve stayed at quite a few all-inclusive resorts over the years, and overall, this one ranks pretty highly, I’d have given it 3.5 stars if that were an option. The setting is gorgeous, the food was genuinely impressive, but a few recurring issues held it back from being a full 5-star experience.

🌟 Highlights
Food: Easily one of the best food offerings we’ve had at a resort like this. The tagine station was consistently delicious, the daily BBQ was a treat, and the desserts were indulgent. The later meal times were handy too. The only downside was that the menu could’ve used more variety over the week.

Grounds & Pools: Beautifully kept with lots of greenery. The Zen Pool lives up to its name, very relaxing. The main pool was lively but never chaotic.

Atmosphere: Outdoor dining was really great with mist sprays keeping things cool. The bar area had a charming “town square” vibe with blooming bougainvillea, really lovely.

Staff: Warm, friendly, and helpful overall. A special shout-out to the on-site medical team who helped me free of charge out with an eye infection and a wasp sting (those little guys are everywhere and i ended up in hospital last time I was stung). On one occasion, however a barman at the Zen bar did mock my accent, which wasn’t great.

Entertainment Team: Loads going on during the day and early evening. The main evening shows weren’t to my taste, I went once and slipped away after 15 minutes, but others seemed to enjoy them. During their weekly White Party they started packing up half way, which was a bit strange!

😕 Letdowns
Drinks Offering: This was the biggest disappointment. Very limited spirit choices (many common ones missing), weak pool cocktails that tasted like squash, and staff often unwilling to make drinks they had the ingredients for. Self-serve drink stations often had no cups, and replenished meal-time wine was warm once the chilled bottles were gone. With just a few more staff and better stock management, this could be vastly improved.

*Beds & Room Comfort: The bed was really uncomfortable, two small mattress protectors that did not fit and a loose sheet that ruffled up nightly. Not ideal for restful sleep. Other minor room issues (balcony door didn’t lock, safe didn’t work, shower gel holder fell off the wall) were eventually fixed, but still frustrating.

📝 Things to Keep in Mind
*Shuttle bus drops you about 25 minutes’ walk from the Medina centre.
*The hotel is a bit remote, some activity providers won’t do pickups from here.
Had to go back several times to get room cards reactivated.
Noticed some guests getting preferential treatment, sunbed and table service, while we were overlooked entirely. It could’ve been language-related, but it didn’t feel great.
Very limited shade by the pools, and fixed umbrellas mean little flexibility.
Management was open to feedback when I submitted a form on our last day, which is a good sign.

This is a lovely hotel in many ways, the food, the setting, the friendly staff really stand out. I just wish the drinks had lived up to the standard set by everything else. A few tweaks would take this from good to great.",Iberostar Waves Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Hotel,Marrakech

Great experience,"Absolutely amazing hotel, entertainment staff were incredible, made you feel extremely welcome and remember you daily even tho they see hundreds of people a week!
food was amazing and different everyday
Kids club looked great we just didn’t use it.
There was a subbed war towards the end of our stay as it got busier only for the ones closest to the pool steps, they were the best ones if you have young kids!
Bar staff work extremely hard especially in the heat. 
Room’s cleaned daily the hotel was very clean intact
Night time entertainment was great but it was extremely hot when we went and it’s of course outside so 36° at 9pm it’s the best! So much to do there! highly recommend and would definitely go back",Iberostar Waves Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Hotel,Marrakech

"Lovely hotel, brilliant staff, drinks could be better.","This is a really nice hotel and we’ve had a great week as a family of 5. 
There are a few pros and cons… 
Pros - there was never a fight for sunbeds we always managed to get one at the kids pool at 9.30 and no drama going to reserve one and then for breakfast. 
The restaurant times were good so you could have a little lie in and still get decent food, same in the evening if you like staying in the pool until closing time there was still hot food being brought out at 9-9.30pm. 
The entertainment team are fabulous they work so hard all day and night getting people involved without being overbearing, round the pool and in the evening. 
The staff are all so nice, friendly, helpful and I didn’t see any bias towards French or anything but obviously they can all communicate much better. If you can tip the bar and waiting staff they are so appreciative and they work so hard! 
The food is always plentiful… at times a little repetitive but I’m a fussy eater and always managed to find something. 
Cons - the drinks… we are familiar with the Iberostar brand and this is why we booked this particular hotel as we know the food and drink is always good however sometimes the beer was flat and cocktails were pre mixed. Brands were extra. 
The food truck only did burgers at lunch and then waffles/pancakes in the afternoon and it wasn’t self serve so resulted in long queues. Same with the drinks it’s help yourself but waiting in long queues to ask for a cup - the bar staff seemed stressed at times. This could be avoided by having paper cups for soft drinks. 
I felt there could have been more of a kids station in the restaurant as we had a 4 year old with us and sometimes we would take a burger in with us for lunch so she could eat with us. 
Overall it’s been a lovely week and the staff really made it so lovely. 
Side note which is nothing to with the hotel but wish id known - the airport is awful, long queues for long times and no air con.",Iberostar Waves Club Palmeraie Marrakech,Hotel,Marrakech

The Place To Stay,"Everything about the hotel is fantastic from the staff to the rooms to the facilities. 
On arrival all
The staff are very welcoming and helpful with luggage. We were given welcome drinks from the bar before heading to the room where are luggage had already arrived. 
The room was huge with the garden view situated on the ground floor. 
Walk in shower and separate bath were excellent. Double sink with large mirror covering the walls. 
Walk-in wardrobe also included within the bathroom area. 
The pools were huge, apparently largest in Marrakech. Pool are was kept clean with a lot of maintenance staff constantly up keeping the grounds. 
The hotel was quiet during our stay so plenty of sun lounges. 
The staff couldn’t do more to help and we had a good chat with imad behind the bar. 
The concierge arranged private taxis to and from the city with pre agreed rate. This was helpful as we were advised the small yellow taxis aren’t allowed to leave the centre of Marrakech. 
The taxi service was excellent and highly recommend all travel using them. We were given a WhatsApp chat to communicate to driver so we could arrange pick up spots in centre. 
The restaurants were all serving amazing food from Italian to Lebanese with prices being reasonable considering the hotel rating. 
The hotel amenities were excellent from the gym to tennis courts. The gym had a good mix of free weights and machines. The spa looked good although we didn’t use this. 
Would highly recommend staying here if planning a trip to Marrakech. The hotel is set within a large complex and there are 2 security barriers before arrival where drivers have to report in making the resort feel extremely safe.",Fairmont Royal Palm Marrakech,Hotel,Marrakech
Top hotel,"The hotel, its staff and its golf course are really good. We had a garden suite which was excellent and the room servicing was almost too good. Staff seemed to be checking if we wanted anything almost hourly !!
The bathrooms are enormous and the bed mega comfortable. Endless N'espresso coffee pods and bottles of water. All by charming staff. 
The lighting system in our suite is so complicated. We didn't really understand it after 12 days 😂
We stayed half board and the breakfasts were wonderful but the sparrows and flies on the open food were a worry. We both had upset tummies early on. 
The blurb told us we had three restaurants to choose from but in fact there are only two. A very good Italian   one that serves Moroccan/ Lebanese. Both were very rich food so on reflection we would have done better to go B & B and popped into town for dinners. 
The golf course is really well maintained and suitable for me off 9 and Susie off 25. They try to insist you have a caddy every round, even if you are in a buggy. You can refuse however at £18 a round so what.  
During our stay my wife had a bad fall that required stitches in her head. The hotel were wonderful. They arranged for a doctor to visit immediately who drive us to the local medical centre for scans and tests and the stitches. He then visited us in our room on three further occasions. Very impressive. 
Minor gripes. Hardly any English TV,
No book of what to see and do. You have to ask the concierge everything. 
We had a his/hers massage. Without asking they added 10% service and then lefta space for 'tips' A pet dislike of mine. 

All in all a great hotel.",Fairmont Royal Palm Marrakech,Hotel,Marrakech
A royal and exceptional stay,"Sublime hotel , from arrival you can feel the greatness of the spaces and the majestic entrance. The great highlight DE the hotel is its exceptional service.

Best hotel in Africa,"Best hotel I stayed in, perfect in every detail. The service providers are extremely kind and attentive.",Royal Mansour Marrakech Hotel,Hotel,Marrakech
Excellence On Every Level,"I have wanted to experience The Royal Mansour Hotel for myself for a long time. I have been fortunate enough to travel extensively throughout my life, staying at hotels of all grades, though my appreciation of those at the luxury end of the spectrum has increased as I have grown older. I have reviewed and assessed hotels for many years and sharing my findings and impressions with people is something I find very pleasurable. Hopefully I have been able to share insight and ideas with my 0.8 million readers.

I saw a documentary about The Royal Mansour several years ago and it certainly captivated my imagination. The hotel is located in the heart of The Medina and is actually a medina within the medina. I found the website to be very helpful in assisting me select the most suitable riad for myself and customer services were very swift in coming back to me with answers to a few questions. I opted for the Premier Riad since it had the highest specifications for one or two persons. I usually travel solo, particularly when I am researching venues.

Whenever possible I like to book directly with a venue rather than through an agency. There are advantages to both methods however this reviewer finds that venues are getting much more competitive in their offers in an attempt to attract customers to book direct. My package gave me a 4-night stay for the price of 3 and I found that to be perfect. Return airport transfers were included, as was fast track through passport control both ways. Breakfast was also included as well as soft drinks from the mini bar. This last point was the only aspect of my stay that did not happen with perfection without the need for me to make daily follow-up requests. The hotel contacted me a few days ahead of my arrival to confirm the arrangements and to identify any specific requirements that I might have. Before I left home I already felt valued.

My arrival was seamless, and as I exited the aircraft and moved towards immigration, I was met en route by the airport fast track representative, who spoke excellent English and was lively and animated. It was a delight to be escorted immediately to an immigration officer who admitted me. I was then handed over to the Royal Mansour driver, Abdelanti, who took me to the awaiting Bentley for the 20-minute drive to the hotel. He was friendly and once again spoke excellent English. He advised me that he has worked for Royal Mansour for 16 years so I believe that says something positive from both sides of the equation.

As I approached the hotel entrance and exited the car, the senior staff from each department were lined up to greet me individually. This was an incredibly personalised and delightful touch. I was seated by a concierge, Mahdi, who served me with mint tea and completed the check-in formalities. He escorted me around the principal locations of the hotel such as the spa and the restaurants, and we then moved on to my riad. I was immediately impressed by the sheer opulence of the building and the high standards to which it was designed, built and furnished. The official check-in time was 15:00 however my riad was ready on my arrival at 11:00 and this was very greatly appreciated.

The ground floor of the riad consisted of a tiled entrance hall leading into an open roofed lounge that had a small fountain. There were comfortable chairs and huge plants and I became instantly aware that I was effectively in my own house. Sliding doors lead into a large sitting room where any guests could be seated comfortably. This led into an internal lounge that was traditionally furnished to an incredibly high standard with tiled floors and high-quality fabric curtains. There was a floral arrangement that was changed during my stay, and a fireplace, a separate table and a fully stocked minibar. The soft drinks were replenished daily, though I did need to remind the hotel each day. The was a high-quality writing desk. All rooms had incredibly high ceilings, and the temperature was individually controlled to a comfortable standard. There was a separate kitchen room that had a microwave and a fridge and more bottled water. There was a toilet on this level and a tiled winding staircase led up to the first floor.

This first floor had an extensive wardrobe and dressing room that was curtained off. A short corridor led to the opulent bedroom that had a wooden parquet floor. The bed was huge and extremely comfortable, with high quality fabrics, pillows and cushions. The bed, linens and pillows were very high quality with a high thread count. There was a small vanity desk by the window and the curtain fabrics were high quality and very effective for blackout. The room benefited from atmospheric lighting that could be individually controlled and had a huge armchair with foot rest. This chair formed a central feature. Again, there was plentiful storage space. Very attractive, floor-to-ceiling carved wooden doors separated a further dressing room that contained a safe. A few rugs and mats were scattered around the room. More carved wooden doors lead to a huge tiled bathroom with a separate toilet and bidet room and a massive shower room. High quality weighing scales were in the room. Two bathrobes were provided and a generous supply of extremely soft and fluffy towels. The room had a massive tiled bath, providing every comfort that could be desired. High quality toiletries were provided.

A further winding staircase led to the third floor, where there was another toilet and a door leading out to the terrace. Views from here were over the roofs of adjacent riads but structured in such a way as to provide complete privacy. It became extremely hot up there during the day and I learned very quickly to be sure I wore the slippers which were provided. On the terrace was a private cabana that provided some protection from the heat during the day. Four attractive tiled steps lead to an upper level, which consisted of two loungers with an umbrella, a fireplace for cooler months and extremely attractive potted plant arrangements. There was a shower and a medium sized plunge pool, which was sun heated and this retained the temperature at night. In colder months the water temperature can be manually adjusted upwards by the hotel. Subtle lighting on the terrace made for a very pleasant experience during hours of darkness. Pool towels were provided and the entire terrace area was extremely relaxing and comfortable. Palm trees were interspersed between the raids.

All rooms had a at least one wall-mounted tablet from which the temperature and the lighting could be individually controlled. There is also a button that control the entire riad with do not disturb signs to the staff. Staff accessed the riad via external and underground tunnels. It took a little adjustment to get used to this but it worked extremely well and the staff were courteous and discreet.

Malika Gargour was my principal housekeeper and she really was sunshine on legs; radiating joy and happiness constantly. My riad was maintained to the highest conceivable standards of cleanliness and brilliance.

There is a large outdoor pool in the complex and also a spa. I did not use these.

There are four restaurants available and breakfast is taken in a delightful outdoor one that provides plenty of shade if desired. A large menu is available and this contains an extensive range of options. The service could not be more welcoming however special mention must go to Mustaffa, who is without doubt especially strong for his warmth and attention to detail. For example, I liked sparkling water to drink and asked for plenty of ice to be provided. A few minutes later, Mustaffa returned proactively not only with ice, but with a small plate of sliced lemon to add to the ice and water. He was the only server to do this during my stay and he displayed an exemplary work ethic. Nothing appeared to be too much trouble for the staff and all requests were received positively. Food items were very fresh and plentiful and refills of anything were freely offered.

I dealt with the reception staff and concierge staff on several occasions and I found these to be extremely accommodating and helpful. Foreign currency could be exchanged at reception and the rate was very fair.

When making arrangements to leave, I was delighted to receive a personalised 6-hour extension to my checkout time as I had a mid-evening flight. This was so helpful and enabled me to take afternoon tea before my departure.

The afternoon tea was extensive and served delightfully, with very fresh products provided. Staff were again attentive.

My stay at Royal Mansour was a true delight and genuinely deserves the five-star rating I have given for the facilities, cleanliness, service and sheer opulence. Although some might consider stays to be expensive, I would defend this by saying that it was perfectly and fairly balanced with extremely high standards that guests enjoy. There are three hotels that stand out with me for providing a complete five star or even six-star experience and both on different continents. Royal Mansour is in joint first place with the other two. I sincerely appreciate the facilities and hospitality that has been offered to me by the management and staff over a most delightful four-night stay.",Royal Mansour Marrakech Hotel,Hotel,Marrakech

Arabian nights 🪄,"We knew the Royal Mansour Marrakech would be an incredible hotel, but it surpassed our very high expectations. 

Words and photos cannot accurately convey how beautiful every detail of the hotel is — not surprising given that it’s the King’s hotel. All the tiling and carvings were done by hand and the riad is a truly special home away from home. We have stayed in many luxury hotels — from well-known brands to boutique resorts — and none come close to the Royal Mansour. The food, service and amenities were excellent and the staff were the best of the best. 

We particularly liked how private the hotel is. Each riad has its own pool on the roof. Housekeeping enters through a special entrance and travel via tunnels and passageways so they are never seen when you’re walking around the hotel. No carts in the hall at Royal Mansour!

We were at Royal Mansour for 5 nights, and it was not enough time to see all the amazing sights in Marrakech, go into the desert and Atlas Mountain, and relax by the pool and spa. HIGHLY recommend staying for at least 7 nights, especially if this is your first trip to Marrakech. (Also recommend Adil from Marrakech Desert for an excursion to the desert/mountains.)

In short, the only negative about the Royal Mansour is that it will ruin all of your future hotel stays!!!

You won’t be disappointed!

It was a shame we could only do 1 night but in future we plan to do 3 nights. We most definitely have to come back. We absolutely loved our butler Yassine. What a great guy!! If we come back we will definitely be requesting Yassine. The breakfast was the best we have ever had. The staff were so accommodating.

Sublime oasis in Marrakesh,"Not quite sure where to start with this review…words like exceptional, incredible, stunning and so so special just don’t do this hotel justice.

Yes it is pricey, probably the only con I can think of because everything else just blew us away. A real life oasis.

From the moment we arrived, we were made to feel so special and the service is incomparable. All the staff, everyone, thank you so much ☺️ .

Then you have the villas of course that kind of takes your breath away.

The hotel gardens, which of course you can’t get a sense of how truly beautiful they are, as you walk towards your villa, all you can smell is jasmine and roses, genuinely, I kid you not.

The main pool is stunning, (I’m running out of adjectives) we had it to ourselves pretty much the whole day we sat by it.

The spa….my fiancé and I both had the traditional hamman which was the perfect way to kick off our holiday, clean off the London grime and prep our skin for some sun.

The food was delicious, our 15 year old son loved Hakasan most, I loved the breakfast, my fiancé loved it all.

Last but not least, Oussama, our Butler, was INCREDIBLE, thank you for looking after us and making our holiday so special.","Mandarin Oriental, Marrakech",Hotel,Marrakech
Beautiful but loud,We went there for our mini moon. Our butler Amine was great and the villas are gorgeous. You are however on the landing path to the airport so you get woken up from 6am. The breakfast was delicious but the service can be quite long. We had an issue with the noise from the AC in the villa but this was resolved by the hotel.,"Mandarin Oriental, Marrakech",Hotel,Marrakech
PARADISE,I had one of the best experiences of my life. A spectacular service and the maid Amine is an added value for the Hotel.,"Mandarin Oriental, Marrakech",Hotel,Marrakech
Incredible Experience with Unparalelled Service,"A timeless stay, the most beautiful hotel we stayed in. The staff is very attentive all your requests are complete.  The whole complex is very clean, bikes available, breakfast is fantastic.  We come back very happy every year!","Mandarin Oriental, Marrakech",Hotel,Marrakech
Beautiful,"We absolutely loved our stay at the Mandarin Oriental Marrakech — truly a five-star experience from start to finish! The property is stunning, the service impeccable, and every detail thoughtfully curated to make guests feel special.

The hotel’s location is perfect: just a quick 10-minute drive from the Medina, and the staff seamlessly arranged tours, transfers, and all the details that made our trip so memorable and effortless. The hotel is quiet, peaceful, so pretty and has everything you need!

During our stay, we visited several other high-profile and popular hotels for dinners and drinks — and we were so happy we chose to stay at the Mandarin Oriental. Without question, we would stay here again in a heartbeat.

A special thanks to Amine, who was incredible — always accessible, endlessly helpful, and who made everything so easy, fun, and stress-free. His care and attention truly elevated our experience. We cannot give enough praise to Amine -- he even helped us find the channel showing the Wimbledon final and picked up medicine for my son. 

The best stay we could have imagined — can’t wait to come back!","Mandarin Oriental, Marrakech",Hotel,Marrakech
Quick trip,"We had an unforgettable daypass, a real moment of happiness and serenity.
I would like to warmly thank Mr. Lyazidi Mohssin for his impeccable welcome, benevolence and exemplary professionalism, a big thank you also to Salah pool 
A big congratulations to the whole team for the quality of the service and the attention to the smallest details. An experience to renew without hesitation!","Mandarin Oriental, Marrakech",Hotel,Marrakech
Amazing Stay,"From arrival to departure attention to detail was very impressive. Especially around the pool where the Lifeguard was very attentive, ensuring that shade was always provided where requested, even moving umbrellas to cope with movements of the sun.
The villa was spotlessly clean, and the restaurants likewise, where the food choices were very impressive.
All round an excellent stay","Mandarin Oriental, Marrakech",Hotel,Marrakech
,"Mandarin Marrakesh hotel is amazing.
Hotel's design, rooms, villas and location are perfect.
Room Service dining service and food were exceptional. Quick service, super friendly staff, tasty food.
I also want to brag about Usama, our Butler. 24/7 available, very professional and friendly.","Mandarin Oriental, Marrakech",Hotel,Marrakech
Great Family stay with excellent service,"We stayed for 7 nights as a family (my wife, two kids, and I) and had a great time. The staff were really friendly and helpful. We arrived a few hours before check-in, but they got us into our room within 40 minutes—and even gave us a free upgrade.

The pool was excellent, like a little oasis in the desert. Some people mention the location, but we didn’t find it an issue. It’s only about 20 minutes from the city center, and there’s a free shuttle running throughout the day.

Big thanks to Hamza in catering, Ahmid by the pool, and the cleaning team—everyone went above and beyond. 
I would highly reccomend this hotel.",Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Hotel,Marrakech
A wonderful hotel where you are completely looked after.,"Sirayane is a beautiful, small hotel on the outskirts of Marrakech. The rooms are very clean, well maintained and generous in size. Our room had its own pool and garden, which was wonderful, although for rooms without a pool there was a good selection of other pools; a heated pool, a kids' paddling pool, an unheated pool and an adults only pool. There were plenty of loungers available for the size of the hotel, so no need to 'reserve' beds with towels. There was also a spa and small gym at the hotel. 
The gardens around the hotel were beautifully maintained - an oasis in the desert.
On our arrival we were greeted with mint tea and there was water, fresh fruit, nuts and moroccan biscuits to welcome us to our room. Each evening a small bottle of water for each guest was delivered to our room for the night/morning. And it was this attention to detail and the extremely high level of customer service that was the stand out for our stay at Sirayane.
The food at Sirayane was delicious with a good selection of moroccan and international fare to choose from. A wonderful selection of fruit, pastries, sweet treats, bread, eggs (cooked however you wished) etc was available at breakfast.  We could not fault either the food or the staff.
Whilst the hotel is a 20 minute drive from Marrakech, the hotel provides a complimentary shuttle bus into and back from the town centre, meaning you can get in and out with ease with minibuses running from morning through to late in the evening.
I have no reservations in recommending this hotel to anyone.",Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Hotel,Marrakech
Amazing Place,"I went with my son recently (19th July - 26th). Excellent facilities and location. Staff so friendly. A shout out goes to Saleh (restaurant manager) and his team. Saleh went above and beyond to help my son who is a fussy eater. Dishes were altered etc. 
Food at the Hotel again is excellent. Being a smaller hotel they do not offer a big variety of food as some places do but the difference is they offer a smaller choice and variety but the difference is in the quality. The quality is so much higher and well worth it. I went with Saleh's daily recommendations and they were always so delicious! i recommend the aubergine in the Moroccan starters. 
Check in and out was a breeze and the free shuttle service was frequent and much appreciated!!
Thank you Sirayane for such a wonderful experience! My son loved the garden and the pool!",Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Hotel,Marrakech
Beautiful stay,"We have just returned from seven nights at this hotel. A little worrying when driving to the hotel. In the middle of an area that’s under construction but don’t let that worry you. The hotel, rooms, staff, pool and spa are all fantastic. Food / drinks are a little pricey compared to other places but great quality. The pool team are simply the best! Everyone so friendly. The Hammam experience in the spa is a must try!",Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Hotel,Marrakech
Lovely hotel but could be improved,"I’ve recently returned from a 4 day break with my adult son. The hotel is lovely. The whole hotel is kept very clean, the rooms are very nice with a fridge and you’ve given a small bottle of water every evening. 
We went half board and the food was excellent however when we did buy lunch it was rather expensive. 
The pool men and the restaurant waiters were superb. I couldn’t fault their service. However the bar staff and the reception staff were rather hit and miss with the pool staff often chasing the bar staff for service. 
The reason I haven’t given 5 stars is its location. The hotel is in the middle of no where and next to a building site. So although they put on a free bus to the centre you can’t walk anywhere at all. There is no shop onsite so you can’t buy drinks or snacks anywhere nearby and have to buy the expensive drinks. The air conditioning unit is in the hall so whilst great it doesn’t blow into the bedroom area meaning that when the heat hit 45 during over visit the bedroom was extremely hot",Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Hotel,Marrakech
A perfect location for a Marrakesh break,"Absolute perfection for a restful week in the African sun

The hotel is stunning!!  In a remote location - don’t be put off by the journey in, there is a lot of local construction due to the upcoming location, but the hotel is set back from the main roads and construction sites - and only a 20 min cab ride from the airport 

Once checked in the team got us into our room early, a pool side room with direct access to the pool thru the small garden terrace. The rooms are spacious, well equipped and impeccably clean with a great AC supply that is definitely needed

The pool area is stunning. With ‘double bed’ sunbeds with a great mattress & pillows. The 3 pool guys are incredibly attentive - will supply towels and move that parasols as often as the sun moves round thru the day. If the main 2 pools get busy there is a smaller adults only pool tucked away  if ever needed - but the main pool area is large enough and quiet enough not to have ventured in ourselves

We stayed half board. Lots on offer at the buffet breakfasts with pancakes and eggs made to order upon request. The evening meals are fantastic. A mixed menu of international and local dishes across all 3 courses - enough for something different every day. The food & beverage team again are incredibly attentive and have impeccable manners - particularly calling the 3 younger waiters who are there for every pouring of wine or water needed!!  Their grasp of the menu is great and can explain the dishes to you- in at least 3 languages!!   Particularly recognise Hatim who looked after us for most of the week - a real credit to the team

We also took advantage if the Spa facilities- clean and cool for a relaxing massage or treatment 

The hotel offers a free shuttle service into the City that is pre booked at reception 2 hrs or more before needed. The cars are punctual and clean - well worth a trip to experience the madness of the souks!!!

Nothing is too much trouble for the staff at the hotel in any position or role they cover. Their good nature and manners are almost embarrassing to cope with, but they deliver it with ease

If we could rate this hotel more than 5 stars we would. Highly recommended and worth the money for such an experience",Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Hotel,Marrakech
Excellent hotel but with the sound of construction in the background,"Very nice hotel with excellent staff and very nice food. The evening menu should offer more salads on the menu like the lunch menu, they’d get more people using the restaurant. 

The down side of the hotel is the construction traffic you can hear with loud reverse bleepers whilst sat by the pool, plus the construction going on around the area.",Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Hotel,Marrakech
Perfect Retreat for and from Marrakesh City Centre,"We chose this hotel because of its good reviews - now we would like to leave our own.
We confirm the following highlights:
- Staff are unassuming and attentive
- Rooms are comfortable, clean and spacious
- The combination of the location and free shuttle bus into the centre worked well. Not too far (about 15 min) and it served as a welcome retreat from the heat, hustle and bustle in the city centre.

A couple of tips:
- Yes, the timings of the free hotel shuttle buses into the city can be limiting but we found a good routine with two round trips a day that served us well and meant we avoided too many private trips at about EU20 a time. Used the mid-morning shuttle into the city to see sights and returned on the mid-afternoon shuttle to relax in the hotel, use the pools and play pool/table tennis. Then used the evening shuttle to return to the city for dinner, returning on the last or second-to-last one back to the hotel.
- Pick up large bottles of drinking water at a kiosk near the shuttle pick-up on your return journey for a fraction of the hotel prices. :)",Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Hotel,Marrakech
Absolutely Exceptional – A Magical Stay in Marrakesh,"Our stay at this hotel in Marrakesh was simply unforgettable. It’s tucked away in a peaceful location that feels like the middle of nowhere, yet it’s conveniently close to the city center. The atmosphere was calm and relaxing, and every corner of the hotel was spotless. You can really see how much care and attention they give to every detail.

The service was truly outstanding. Everyone made us feel welcome and well taken care of throughout our stay. I especially want to thank Youssef at the pool. He was always smiling and checking on the guests, adjusting the umbrellas to make sure we stayed cool and comfortable. His kindness and attentiveness really stood out.

In the restaurant, we were served by Said, Zuhair, and Hatem , three young and incredibly professional waiters. They were always friendly, patient, and made us feel genuinely welcome every time. Whether we were eating at the restaurant, by the pool, or in our room, they always provided excellent service with a smile.

And the food… absolutely delicious. Every meal was à la carte, beautifully presented, and full of flavor. The quality was exceptional, and each dish had that extra touch of luxury that made dining feel like a real treat.

The rooms were perfectly clean, and the free shuttle to the city center made everything even more convenient. There's also a lovely spa on-site that’s definitely worth discovering if you're looking for some relaxation and self-care.

This hotel is a true gem in Marrakesh. I sincerely recommend it to anyone looking for a peaceful, high-quality experience with authentic Moroccan hospitality. We’ll definitely be coming back.",Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Hotel,Marrakech
"An exceptional stay, the Sirayane should be the new hotel standard in Marrakech","An exceptional stay, the Sirayane becomes my new hotel standard

I spent 7 nights this week at the Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa and I can say, without hesitation, that it was an exceptional experience at all levels. From the moment of booking, the tone was set: in their email, the team wrote to me ""we will have the pleasure of welcoming you to our marrakchi paradise to book you the best welcome ever"". I thought wow, they’re setting the bar high. Well... promise kept, it was really the best welcome ever.

Constant smiles, constant attention. Whether it is the reception, restaurant, room service, bar or maids: everyone gives the sincere feeling of being there to please you. Even on the phone, you “feel” a smile. I’ve never seen a team so warm, so invested.

I was with my son, and they were adorable to him from beginning to end.

We stayed in a suite with private pool: an incredible setting surrounded by olive trees, absolute calm. The rooms are super spacious, very comfortable, very well appointed, tastefully decorated. On the catering side, special mention to the ""Weeping Tiger"", a dish to fall on the ground.

The hotel manager stopped by regularly to make sure everything was going well. One morning we missed breakfast: the team kindly told us that if we had called, they would have gladly brought it to us. This kind of little attention makes you feel unique. Towels that are brought to the pool with a smile, Moroccan cookies with tea... everything is designed for your comfort, without ever being intrusive.

This is one of the most beautiful hotel experiences I have ever had. I will come back, that is a certainty. The Sirayane has become my new hotel standard.

A huge thank you to the whole team for this holiday of pure relaxation.",Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Hotel,Marrakech
A perfect oasis with first class service,"A beautiful, classical oasis of tranquility in the midst of the old medina.

Safe and fridge provided free of charge in the room. 
Reasonably priced beer and several cute places in the garden to drink it!

We stayed at the start and end of a two week trip - and were able to enjoy the pool area and the restaurant.  In addition - make sure you enjoy a sundowner on the roof terrace, it's a lovely place.  Our rooms were perfect - we opted for garden rooms and were not disappointed.  Comfortable beds and very spacious.  Most importantly - the staff at this riad are so friendly and helpful.",Les Jardins de la Medina,Hotel,Marrakech
Great stay at Les Jardins de la Medina,"Beautiful small hotel/riad within Marrakesh medina. Good sized rooms that are spotlessly kept and the air conditioning works perfectly- much needed. Pool area fantastic and most relaxing. Exceptional pool/restaurant/reception staff, very attentive without being in your face. Food pricey for Marrakesh but the one evening we eat there the standard was high. Would recommend to friends and will go again",Les Jardins de la Medina,Hotel,Marrakech
Great hotel in great location.,"This hotel was the perfect location for a week’s trip to Marrakesh.  It is in the medina and is in walking distance to most attractions.  If you don’t like to walk then a taxi is very cheap at around £5 per trip.
The staff at this hotel are truly there to give you a wonderful experience and nothing is too much trouble for them.  The hotel is spotless with super comfortable beds and rooms have air conditioning.  Turn down service is available each night where they come and spray your pillows with essential oil of your choice. On arrival you are greeted with a welcome drink and some cookies/ cakes and nuts.
The rooms are all different and unique and this adds to the charm of the hotel.  
The pool area is beautiful and towels available.  If u had to be critical I would say the pool area loungers could be padded which would make them more comfortable but they are fine.  There is an outdoor lounge area on the roof and it is beautiful but not used to its full potential- this should have a bar with drinks and coffee/tea available and more people would use it.
The food including breakfast was delicious and very reasonable. 
I would most definitely stay in this hotel if revisiting Marrakesh.  Well done to all staff absolutely excellent service.",Les Jardins de la Medina,Hotel,Marrakech
Great city centre hotel. Just perfect !,We stayed 3 nights at this beautiful hotel. The location is fantastic in the heart of the city but you can come back to the tranquility of the gorgeous pool. The rooms are in keeping with the beautiful Moroccan architecture and are well equipped and very comfortable and very clean . The breakfast was delicious and lots of variety. The dinner menu had both international and Moroccan cuisine. The reception arranged transport each day for us with English speaking drivers who were always very prompt. The reception also gave great restaurant recommendations and made bookings for us outside the hotel. We also did the city waking tour which was also arranged by the hotel and was a great introduction to this magical city. Finally the staff were incredibly friendly and always willing to help but did seem a little over worked at times. This was a fantastic hotel and great value and I would definitely recommend for your Marrakesh city visit.,Les Jardins de la Medina,Hotel,Marrakech

Lunch at the riad,"My partner and I had some delicious lunch at the restaurant of Les Jardin De Le Medina Riad. Uppon arrival we were greeted politely, and got sat to our table. Which looked out at the stunning garden and the pool. The service was excellent and our waiter was very attentive. 
I was impressed with the quality of the food in comparison to the price. Would totally come again when visiting Marrakech.",Les Jardins de la Medina,Hotel,Marrakech
Superb stay!,"Our stay at the Jardins de la Médina was superb!
At the Medina gardens you feel as if you were staying with friends but with 
the attentions and services of a great hotel! 

The professionalism, attention and beauty of the place made our stay an unforgettable one. 

The kitchen is delicious! A well-balanced mix of European and Eastern cuisine! 

We also enjoyed the spa that we greatly enjoyed!  

We will definitely be back! 

If we have a little criticism to make, it’s about the day pass.The crowd of people from outside the hotel disturbs the tranquility of the place a bit, unfortunately. Especially since often there have been quite a lot of groups.
Nevertheless we were able to enjoy the pool.

Many thanks to the whole team and we hope to see you soon!",Les Jardins de la Medina,Hotel,Marrakech

Stunning,"This is an absolutely stunning property (once you find it!) . We stayed outside the Medina for most of our holiday but wanted to experience the Moroccan culture at its best and chose this Riad from a luxury UK tour operator's brochure. It did not disappoint and as being a surprise for my husband it added to the magic. The members of the team are beyond professional and welcoming. We were shown around and everything was explained into detail from meal and bar hours to pool location and procedures. The room was on the ground floor, very spacious with a sitting area and a  beautiful bathroom. Shower worked to perfection as well as the air con. The Riad is in a quiet location just off one of the main crazy streets with local vendors. It is approx 15 min walk to the main square and maybe 20 min walk to the Koutoubia mosque. 
We chose to have breakfast on the roof top and it was just great. It consisted of plain omelette, yoghurt and cereals, freshly baked breads, jams, local honey and traditional cakes, served with plenty of coffee and tea at your choice. The owner is well known in the area and received many iconic personalities over the years. We had the pleasure to meet him as well as his hard working grandson who is a credit to the business. Presentable and speaking impeccable English. 
All in all a wonderful experience and if given the chance we would return to Marrakech and stay in this Riad a bit longer. Shukram!",Riad Kniza,Hotel,Marrakech
Bombastic awesome great stay,"It already started with the welcome, delicious mint tea incredibly friendly welcome!!! When then our room was ready, well is more of a suite, very clean they pay attention to every detail, you feel incredibly comfortable here and would like to always stay here. Every day new bathrobe, bath and towels. My dress had to be mended and she there, 30 min hung my dress in the room!!:-) there are not enough stars to rate this riad just awesome riad. LOCATION is also perfect. So we'll be back",Riad Kniza,Hotel,Marrakech
Best stay ever!!,"I rarely stay at such a nice place like the riad. The room was beautiful. The hotel it‘s self very nice, so were the amenities. The food was just awesome, healthy and authentic.

I can recommend anybody to visit the riad kniza if you plan on visiting marrakesh.",Riad Kniza,Hotel,Marrakech
Perfect riad in a busy city,"Everything about this riad was just right. The owner even took the time to tell my husband and I hello. Our room was more than enough and serviced multiple times a day. We sank into our bed--it was so comfortable. I loved that breakfast was served between a wide time frame ending at noon. With the city really coming to life later at night, the later start was welcomed. You can walk to many main attractions from this locations but because of its location outside of the medina it may take 10-20 minutes.",Riad Kniza,Hotel,Marrakech
Riad Kniza was a brilliant place to stay in Marrakesh.,"Riad Kniza was a delightful welcoming place to stay. Any question or request was kindly attended to. The building was a beautiful example of a riad with numerous pleasant spaces to relax and enjoy. The meals were excellent with polite, friendly service and accompanied in the evening with charming, subtle musicians. The highlight for me was visiting the owner's personal museum with a knowledgeable, articulate guided tour by his grandson. The location was very convenient for visiting both the Medina and the Gueliz tights. Altogether a wonderful experience!",Riad Kniza,Hotel,Marrakech
A GEM IN MARRAKESH,"What a delightful surprise! The service  levels were amazing. The rooms were wonderful. And the rooftop terrace. WOW! The staff couldn’t lhave been nicer. I was greeted  with mint tea and pastries before being shown to my room. On my final night, my friend and I shared a bottle of wine and a mezza plate on the rooftop for dinner. One of the best meals of our stay in Marrakesh. I HIGHLY recommend this Riad. It is an oasis of calm outside the chaos of the Marrakesh streets.",Riad Kniza,Hotel,Marrakech
An absolute gem in the middle of the Medina.,"A friend and I stayed at Riad Kniza for 3 nights in May 2025 and had the most amazing time there.  The place is absolutely gorgeous, the bedrooms are large and very clean, and the restaurant offers a wonderful menu.  But what made our stay an absolute delight was the staff:  from Lamia and Abdoul at front desk (who took care of all of transfers and reservation), to Samir, and Sidi Mohammed (the owner) who was always available if we had any questions.  We are already planning to go back and this time we will stay longer.",Riad Kniza,Hotel,Marrakech
"Riad Kniza, Marrakech","Location was great, compared to other places this Riad was very easy find and get to. Easy walking distance to all the attractions and the main square in the Medina. Riad Kniza staff were very helpful and very professional. They have a nice pool but it is not heated though. They have a good collection of local art related books, a fantastic gallery and lot of art effects to see and appreciate. The room we stayed in was a good size with everything one needs, with air conditioning and a heater. They provide bottled water free of charge and good quality fruit plate in the room. The restaurant menu is static and does not change much, so the same food is on the menu everyday ( At least during our 4 nights stay). A changing menu would have been nice. Overall a great place and we will definitely stay here in the future.",Riad Kniza,Hotel,Marrakech
An oasis of hospitality and tranquility in the heart of the medina,"It was a wonderful discovery. Welcomed with great kindness and care, we found a place where every detail is thought to make the guest feel special. All staff are extremely considerate, attentive but never intrusive.

The presence of the owner, a man of great culture and rare elegance, is one of the most precious features of the riad. With its discreet attention, it sets the tone for an authentic welcome that is perceived everywhere.

The rooms are spotless, quiet and full of charm, a real refuge in the frenzy of the medina. We had dinner one evening in the charming courtyard: a real experience of relaxation and Moroccan flavors, served with great grace.

A place that knows how to be remembered, and to which we would return with pleasure.

We stayed in Junior Suite 26, a beautifully designed room with its own private terrace. The hotel boasts two stunning pools, including one on the rooftop with sweeping views, perfect for unwinding after a day of exploring.

Week at the Villa Des Orangers,"We stayed at the Villa Des Orangers for nearly a week; it is an absolutely stunning property. The rooms are like small apartments with incredible furnishings and features you don't find in other hotel rooms. We were lucky enough to stay in two suites, and one had two levels with a gorgeous balcony on the second floor, big spacious rooms, and bathroom. The second suite was massive, with your own private terrace with a lounging area and outside shower. The pool is beautiful; the grounds are so well kept that having a cool glass of wine in one of the areas surrounded by greenery after a day at the markets is a beautiful experience. The staff is incredible. Friendly and helpful, and the breakfasts, lunches and dinners all served beautifully and deliciously. We didn't catch her name, but one of the staff at the main reception area is so helpful. She recommended three restaurants in Marakesh and we had dinner at all three and each one was spectacular.  Lounge by the pool for tranquillity between activities or have a traditional hammam in the spa.",Villa Des Orangers - Hotel,Hotel,Marrakech

When I offered to pay the difference between the two rooms, I was greeted with, ""There will be no additional charge"".  So nice of them.

A great location to access the Medina.",Riad Les Trois Mages,Hotel,Marrakech
a little piece of heaven,"A heartfelt note of thanks to Aziz, Ali, and the entire team at Riad Les Trois Mages. They could not have made our stay more welcoming.

On the morning of our balloon ride, Ali graciously accompanied us just before five in the morning and waited with us until our bus service arrived. On my birthday, we were surprised with a pretty banner and cakes left in our room. They also organised a cake for a friend who visited the Riad one evening, allowing us to celebrate his upcoming 40th birthday.

A little stay in Marrakech,"Just returned from a 3 night stay. The Riad was beautiful, you definitely knew you were staying in Marrakech. We were met at the door by Aziz who was incredibly kind and helpful, both with directions, recommdations and the all important map!
Ali and the rest of the team were friendly and happy to serve us coffee whenever we wanted it and served us breakfast on the roof top which was a lovely experience. 
Massive thanks to you all for making it a lovely stay.",Riad Les Trois Mages,Hotel,Marrakech
Impeccable hospitality in a beautiful setting,"This riad is a beautiful oasis of calm and the middle of Marrakesh, with warm and professional staff team who provide incredible hospitality. We stayed for four nights with two small children, and I wish we could have stayed longer.

The location is a short walk from all of the main sites in the Medina, but tucked away from the busiest streets. The rooms and common areas are stunningly decorated, and the breakfasts are generous, varied and delicious. Aziz, the manager, was friendly and very kind to our young children, while Ali who worked mornings and nights was always welcoming and responsive. The whole team was amazing at anticipating what we might need and discreetly providing it before we even knew we needed it. 

The rooftop terrace is a beautiful place to take in the sunset and listen to the call to prayer, and even take a dip (although if you visit in winter note that the pool will be chilly!). I had to work remotely a couple of times while we visited and was always brought a beautiful tray of coffee while I worked, which was much appreciated. We also ordered a dinner at the riad and it was delicious and very generous, and such a special memory to enjoy it on the rooftop terrace. 

We travel independently quite a bit and have stayed in all kinds of hotels around the world, including five star ones, and I can honestly say that we have never received better service and hospitality than we did at Riad Trois Mages. We will return for sure.",Riad Les Trois Mages,Hotel,Marrakech
Ideal friendly place to stay in Marrakech,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Les Trois Mages with a group of friends. The owner/manager Aziz and his team including Ali and the girls made us so welcome. They will do anything to help you get the most out of your visit to Marrakech. They organised a memorable trip to the Ourika valley in the Atlas Mountains for us, and they cooked a Moroccan feast for us one night - this was definitely one of the best meals we had in Marrakech. The location is ideal - it is down a quiet backstreet but two minutes walk to the local square, Place Riad Larousse, from which you can enter the souk. We can't wait to return!",Riad Les Trois Mages,Hotel,Marrakech
Beautiful Riad with good location and super service,"Beautifully furnished Riad with best location close to the Souken, but still very quiet. 
Nice breakfast and overall super good service all days from especially host Aziz, who stood ready with help and advice. 
We would definitely recommend Riad Les Trois Mages.",Riad Les Trois Mages,Hotel,Marrakech
a comfortable week in the riad of the three wise men,"A week in the turbulence of Marrakech but so quiet once back at the riad of the three Magi
A riad where hospitality, kindness, delicacy of teams and professionalism are the keywords.
Thank you AZIZ and your collaborators for surrounding us so well You send a beautiful picture of your country.

Riad Les Trois Mages,"This Riad is a beautiful haven of tranquillity. From the moment the door is opened by the softly spoken Aziz, to the minute you leave, it is nothing but fabulous. The rooms are stunningly beautiful and styled with Moroccan furniture and artefacts, and the beds are very comfortable. Breakfast is a vast array of breads, jams, eggs, yoghurt etc and to eat it on the rooftop with a view over Morocco is amazing. If you are up early enough, you can watch the hot air balloons rise gracefully into the morning sun.
Aziz is more than helpful,booking restaurants and organising trips, as well as being a fantastic tour guide. The Riad is beautifully clean, the staff are lovely. Book this Riad, you will love it.",Riad Les Trois Mages,Hotel,Marrakech
"Exceptional Riad, perfectly located with wonderful service and interiors","There are many riads in Marrakech to choose from, if you’re reading the reviews for Riad Les Trois Mages you know you need look no further. Set slightly away from the main streets, the peaceful oasis with rooftop pool is the perfect respite from the city with gorgeous interiors and a fantastic breakfast. Aziz has built a safe haven, he provided tips and local knowledge throughout our stay and has a special talent for outstanding service. What a hidden gem!",Riad Les Trois Mages,Hotel,Marrakech
Worth a trip to Morocco,Excellent stay in beautiful riad.  The decor was perfect and a nice harmony and taste in colours and furniture. The staff was helpful and very service minded. Quality brakfast with Moroccan taste. Easy to go to the market and taxi station nearby.,Riad Les Trois Mages,Hotel,Marrakech
"Fantastic 7 night stay, wish it was longer","We stayed here for a week and we wished it could have been longer. 

1 negative that needs to be addressed imo is the sunbed situation. Our 1st morning there, I woke up at 6.45am and reserved the last 3 sunbeds!! After this, it got earlier everyday, it wasn't great.
The other small negative was lack of bar staff at the pool bar. Very often it would be just 1 person so the queue could become big. 

Hasna at reception was so friendly and helpful. 
Be aware there is a £40 damage deposit which is held not taken from your bank until you check out. Towels are a £20 deposit pp until you hand them back but can be changed daily. Also a tourist tax. We paid £21 for 2 adults and 1 child for a week.
This hotel is very relaxed, great vibe around the pool, this isn't the biggest but it has different levels which is good for adults and kids. Also have the kids pool with 4 slides and water features. There is a relaxed area for over 16's, loads of sunbeds and a help yourself bar. Plenty going on, darts, ping pong, water polo and so on, although the football team was for adults only. Perhaps could have been more for the kids other than kids club.
Entertainment staff are fantastic, Pitchu the stand out. He's brilliant with all the guests and really happy all the time.
Fatima and Omar at the pool bar were great, always smiling, nothing was too much for them. 
There are so many wasps at the pool bar but all they are interested in is the syrup, they are not at all interested in humans. I've never seen anything like it but it really isn't an issue.
Our room was just a double room but was great. Loads of space and a huge bathroom. A safe, which is free to use, we had a garden which was nice too.
Evening entertainment was really good, quiz night was fun, karaoke night was interesting, a welcome show on the Monday (fire show from Pitchu the highlight). 
Soufaine at the inside bar was great, very happy chap, if there was a cocktail you wanted and the ingredients were available he would make it for you.
Drinks in general were really good. Plenty on offer.
Anyone complaining about the food clearly have a boring appetite. There was so much variety, fish, meat, vegetarian etc. kids corner was good also. Loads of desserts and ice-cream.
I read a review about the restaurant that they left because the menu was ""small"". It was arguably the best meal I had. Food was unbelievable. Highly recommend, book on arrival.
There is a free shuttle to the market, it is chaos but well worth a visit. Do the morning 1st as it's quieter, the evening is very busy. A polite ""no thank you"" will keep them off your back. Also, haggling is a must as they start high.
We visited the water park and did a camel ride with sunset and a meal. Both superb excursions, booked via the app ""get your guide"". Very reasonably priced.
We loved Morocco and will look to return one day in the near future. 
Overall, a superb stay for us in a very chilled environment.",Be Live Experience Marrakech Palmeraie,Hotel,Marrakech
A great place to stay for a family but get more sun beds,"We had a great holiday. Great food and good shuttle bus into Marrakesh. Friendly staff, great room and great value for money. The camel riding and quad biking excursions were great. 

Cons: music a bit too loud, we had no sunbeds the first few days until we realised you needed to set an alarm at 6am to get a sunbeds. 

The a la carte restaurant was a bit pointless, very few items on the menu and was a bit naff. We left and went to the great buffet instead. 

Pool is a bit too small for the amount of people but overall we had a great time.",Be Live Experience Marrakech Palmeraie,Hotel,Marrakech
Amazing Experience at the resort - 7 Day Visit,"Pre-Arrival Information
Check-in: Monday, July 28th at 3:00 PM
Costs to expect upon arrival:
City Tax: 231 MAD for 2 adults and 2 children.
Refundable Deposit: 1300 MAD for the room and 4 towel cards.
Tip: Book the à la carte restaurant on your first day to avoid delays.
Free Shuttle: The hotel provides free bus tickets to the old town market.

The food was excellent, with a different menu each day. We particularly appreciated how helpful and accommodating the hotel management was regarding my son's nut allergy, ensuring he had a variety of safe meal options throughout our 7-day stay. Drinks and nightly entertainment were also plentiful.

We took part in a number of daily activities, including darts, water pong, water polo, and water aerobics.

On our fourth night, we enjoyed a meal at the à la carte restaurant. The kids loved the chicken strips, fries, and a vanilla dessert afterward.

We pre-booked the shuttle to the Old Town the night before, as you need a ticket to board. The bus left at 9:30 AM and returned at 12:30 PM, giving us about 2.5 hours to explore and shop. We chose this time because the weather was cooler than midday.

Be aware of vendors with snakes and monkeys on the way to the market. A firm but polite ""La Shukran"" (No thank you) is all you need to keep them from bothering you. When shopping, remember that prices are aimed at tourists, so be prepared to haggle for at least 70% off the initial asking price.

Noise: Rooms near the main hotel can be loud due to music until midnight, which isn't ideal for families with young children.

Kids' Club: The kids' club could be improved. The staff didn't seem very engaged with the children, leading to a lack of interest. It was also not offered on our first day.

Drinks: The hotel could do with a few more bar staff particular in the morning by the pool as it could take a few minutes for you to get your drinks.

Sunbeds: This was huge. Like most hotels there are not enough sunbeds. Although the hotel has a policy to not reserve we still found everyone would wake up from 4:00 am on ward and lay there towels on the beds.",Be Live Experience Marrakech Palmeraie,Hotel,Marrakech
Great Family Holiday.,"We (two adults, four children from 17-14) spent 10 days here in July and had a fantastic time. We had two duplex rooms and they were brilliant family spaces, particularly as they had two bathrooms, a must with 4 teenagers. Our rooms were cleaned daily and to a high standard, as were the public areas of the hotel too. It seemed like the cleaning staff never stopped.

We found the food in the restaurant was great and never had any problems finding something we enjoyed, even the fussy 14 year old. The waiting staff were brilliant too, making sure we had what we needed but not hovering over us either. We were also happy with the drinks available too, whether it was the local beer and wine or the soft drinks for the children. The cocktails were fine, much better than in other AI hotels we have stayed in. We ate in the A La Carte restaurant once and it had a limited menu, but everything we had was delicious. 

The entertainment team were fantastic. They were great at getting you involved if you wanted to but equally respected your choice if you didn't want to do the activity on offer. The poolside was definitely lively but not obnoxiously so. The highlight for the 16 and 14 year old was the daily water polo game :-)

The reception team were also great, they had to reset our keys several times and always did it with a smile. They also helped my partner ensure we had the right place pinned on maps when we were off into Marrrakech for a guided tour and booked our taxi for us. We also used the courtesy bus a couple of times to go into the city and it was fine. You do have to book it in advance but this isn't a problem. 

Our main and only gripe was the sunbed situation. I was 'lucky' on two days and managed to get 4 together at about 8:30am but apart from that we never managed it and usually ended up setting ourselves up at a table at the snack bar. This wasn't a major problem for us because the teenagers weren't too fussed but would have been more of a problem if the children had been younger. There clearly aren't enough sunbeds and then some people are selfish and reserve sunbeds early but don't use them at all. We witnessed beds with towels on empty for hours. However, if the pool staff were notified of this they did remove the towels. We actually set up camp in the adult only area on our last two days, despite having two under 16s with us. It is essentially an unused space because there is only one umbrella up there so we were (mostly) the only ones up there. 

Overall, we would recommend this hotel and would definitely stay here again.",Be Live Experience Marrakech Palmeraie,Hotel,Marrakech
Amazing holiday,"We had an amazing stay at this hotel. We came with another family and have children from aged 6-16 years. This resort has something for everyone. 
What stood out the most was the amazing staff they were all so friendly and happy and made it an unforgettable stay. We will definitely be back soon. Food amazing always plenty of choice, rooms large and really clean, pool lovely, plenty of activities. Sunbeds were limited but staff are always on hand to help, most of the problem comes from people saving sunbeds but not using them all day. Looking forward to booking again.",Be Live Experience Marrakech Palmeraie,Hotel,Marrakech
Nice holiday with my family,"We had a fantastic stay at Be Live Experience Marrakech – perfect for families looking for a mix of relaxation, culture, and fun! Here’s a breakdown of what stood out:
⭐ Entertainment & Activities
The hotel offers a great variety of entertainment throughout the day and evening. From morning fitness sessions to pool games, dance classes, and nightly shows, there’s always something going on. The evening performances were lively and varied – traditional Moroccan music, live bands, and even family-friendly comedy.

Lovely family holiday - Sunbed nightmare!!,"Pros;
The hotel is clean and lovely well kept gardens,  the reception staff are good and will help sort out issues. Most of the bar staff are happy and pleasant except 2 that are rude and clearly favour French & local over the English ( i won't name & shame). Duplex rooms are good   the 2 bathrooms are great for family's. Cleaned daily with fresh towels/water.
Food hit & miss for us as we have a couple of fussy eaters but there is always the snack bar.
The entertainment is not the best they do try and are very enthusiastic. picco ( not sure of his name) steals the show he's so talented and clearly males up the entertainment.
There is nothing for kids out of the pool, the park area is only accessible via the kids club and is in direct sunlight so unable to use it as its only open a few hours a day and it's not the best. Could really do with some children play area in the shade small park for the kids to play.
The gym is small but good equipment and it was never overcrowded. 
We have had 2 good days of music around the pool DJ one day and another day it was English mix from 70s /80s to modern but just 1 day 🙄.Aqua gym is hit & miss the guys are great. We are still here are having a good time the hotel would be perfect if they addressed a few issues.
Cons;
The sunbed situation is a nightmare, 6am I was up today and there was about 15 beds free I don't blame people as if one does all will otherwise you will be on the grass. There is plenty of area for more beds and considering there is nothing outside the hotel they need to sort this, same in the evening there is clearly not enough tables & chairs but there is room for more.
There is nowhere to have a little walk to nothing for miles the supermarket is about 1 hour round trip ( not woth it ) hence why the hotel shop is very expensive. £16 - £24 for suncream so bring plenty. 
We booked the restaurant last night and have our 2nd visit booked for tomorrow we will be cancelling the food was shocking and my family said the worse they have had since we came 😬.
Would i come back - not until the sort sunbed & seating. I wouldn't come for our main family holiday as not enough to keep the kids entertained for ourselves, and 10 days here to long without good entertainment.
Overall we have had a lovely family holiday and made happy memories..
Tips: 
Bring  insulated cups with lids ( staff happy to fill ) 
If you can't get q bed borrow the ones from the adult section as its hardly used 😊 oh and the tent up there has not been cleaned since we got here vodka bottles and litter been there over a week now.. ",Be Live Experience Marrakech Palmeraie,Hotel,Marrakech

Outstanding Moroccan Hospitality at Its Best!,"Our stay at this hotel was exceptional, far better than other hotels we’ve experienced in Casablanca city center. The staff were warm, professional, and genuinely welcoming. The breakfast was delicious, the rooms were spotless, and the reception team exceeded expectations.

A special thanks to Sara, who followed all the standards perfectly during check-in and even upgraded us to a better room, making our stay even more memorable. Ezoubir was also incredibly helpful and cheerful during check-out, leaving us with a smile.

Nice but not child friendly,"The hotel disappointed a bit, especially when it comes to facilities for children. There was a clear lack of activities and play areas that could engage the smallest. The only pool available was both too small and too deep for smaller children – making it stressful and insecure for parents. It seemed as if families with children were not a priority, and the staff did not seem to pay much attention to the needs of the children. There was also no child-friendly entertainment, playground or children's menu in the restaurant. All in all not a child-friendly place and we would not recommend it to families with young children.","Radisson Blu Hotel, Marrakech Carre Eden",Hotel,Marrakech

A quality customer experience - stay from 30 May to 2 June 2025,"We stayed three nights at the Radisson Blu in Marrakech as part of a sisters anniversary trip.

Thanks to Mr. Rida Laachari marked our stay. His kindness, hospitality and attention to detail were exemplary.
Also, the breakfast was varied and tasty, served in a pleasant setting.
Special mention also for facial treatment at the spa: it is one of the best I have experienced, with real know-how and a soothing atmosphere.

✔️ What I preferred: the quality of customer service thanks to Mr. Laachari, the exceptional spa treatment, the kindness of the staff at breakfast.
❌ What I liked less: the welcome of the first evening, but which was caught up by the smiles and elegant gestures of Mr. Laachari and other staff during the stay.

Thanks again to the team.","Radisson Blu Hotel, Marrakech Carre Eden",Hotel,Marrakech

Perfect Stay,"I’m 3 months late to write a review , as promised to Nora but better late than never— this place truly deserves every bit of praise.

On our arrival, we were welcomed with a basket of fresh fruits and a glass of the most refreshing mint tea — a perfect introduction to the hotel’s warm and traditional charm. The interiors are beautifully styled with an old-world aesthetic that immediately makes you feel both relaxed and immersed in local culture.

Nora was an exceptional host — always polite, gentle, and genuinely helpful. She guided us on the best places to visit and even shared some practical tips on how to negotiate in the local markets, which made our excursions so much more enjoyable.

One of the highlights came at the end of our trip. Our flight was in the late afternoon, and after an early excursion, we had a few hours to spare in the heat. With our luggage safely stored in their drop-off room, Nora and her husband kindly allowed us to spend the few hours in their library. It was a cool and quiet sanctuary — my wife even managed to get a good nap on the couch while the sun blazed outside. It’s this kind of thoughtful hospitality that really stays with you.

The only thing to keep in mind: if you're taking a taxi from the airport, make sure the driver drops you directly at the hotel, not at the entrance of the kasbah. Otherwise, you may end up walking almost half a mile with your bags — not ideal after a long journey.

All in all, I wholeheartedly recommend this hotel for its traditional charm and, above all, its incredibly kind and attentive staff. Thank you again, Nora — we hope to visit again someday!

Excellent for dine in or takeaway!,"I have ordered food to takeaway from this restaurant two times in the last four days because it is so fresh and so reasonably priced. The service is excellent whether you eat in or takeaway. The menu is beautiful, the salads are fresh, and the hummus is the best I have tasted in Marrakech.

They take pride in what you are receiving and tonight the owner or manager made sure that I left happy.

I will definitely recommend this restaurant which is in a fun part of the souk, only 10-15 minute walk from Jemaa El-Fna Square.

5 stars all the way.",Naranj,Restaurant,Marrakech

La Pergola is on the roof terrace of Riad Monceau, we quickly notice that it is not very clean.

Unable to open windows for unknown reason.

Bring a torch..,"Bring a torch…

Heard so many great things about Comptoir, however failed to live up to its expectations for us. The restaurant theming is beautiful, with a great atmosphere and live music. However, lights are not popular here. Be prepared to use a torch light to read the menu. Service was great to start then slowed down considerably when the restaurant got busier. For whatever reason the waitress didn’t seem best pleased when we asked to pay by card. Must prefer cash tips.. The food itself was okay at best. Lamb tacos were nice, along with the weeping tiger steak, but neither was warm. The meatball tagine was very dry also. The caramel fondant for dessert was the highlight. Beautiful. What you pay for a meal here, in my opinion, doesn’t compare to what you might find in the Medina. One final point, dress code on their website is not enforced.",Comptoir Darna Marrakech,Restaurant,Marrakech

The place is super classy, with a refined and festive atmosphere. The dancers were beautiful and very pleasant, adding a real touch of elegance to the evening.

The presentation of the plates was neat, and our waiter was just great: attentive, smiling and professional. Honestly, 10/10! Only small downside, a slight waiting time to be installed, but nothing very serious. An address I recommend without hesitation!",Comptoir Darna Marrakech,Restaurant,Marrakech
No real interest,"Very nice place no doubt about it but if you are looking for something authentic and typical Moroccan, this is not the right place. Menu as expensive as the French Riviera, restaurant completely Europeanized like many establishments in Marrakech. 
That said our waiter was friendly. Fairly haughty hostesses probably thinking they hold a crazy power with the mandatory reservation. 
I wouldn't advise my relatives.",Comptoir Darna Marrakech,Restaurant,Marrakech

If the meat in the Tex Mex burger is good, and the sauces or presentation are nice, the fries are really basic, just like the burger bread or salad. There is not much missing from this address to be in my eyes better, up to its note. Even to raise prices a little but have home fries and baker burger breads.

Depending on whether you want to eat or just take a drink, you have time slots as it is that popular. On the night we went there was live music which was excellent, but we didn't stay too late - it ramps up later into the evening with a DJ, so a good spot for a few cocktails.",Dardar Rooftop Cocktails & Eat,Restaurant,Marrakech
Nice experience!,"Very nice family experience!
Whether the atmosphere, the decor, the view or the food everything was perfect.
If you come to Marrakech, go ahead!",Dardar Rooftop Cocktails & Eat,Restaurant,Marrakech

The perfect Marrakech sunset 🌅,"A friend recommended dardar for a golden hour sunset spot and it did not disappoint.
Beautiful views across Marrakech and stunning sunset.
The staff were attentive and service was very quick. The food was excellent as was the music choice throughout the evening.
Our table booking for 2.5 hours so we arrived at 7.30 got to see the sunset, had a long relaxing meal and some great drinks.
After food there was a real party atmosphere helped by a couple of birthdays in different groups.
Would certainly come again on our next trip.",Dardar Rooftop Cocktails & Eat,Restaurant,Marrakech
Ga vooral naar rooftop Dardar!!!,"What a great rooftop terrace is on restaurant Dardar in the Medina. Take a lunch, dinner or a drink. You never have to sit in the sun, there is enough sun protection. The dishes are fine and the staff is very friendly.

Rooftop *****,All excellent from service to food!!! A rooftop with very good atmosphere!!’excellent sunset!!! Near the square.,Dardar Rooftop Cocktails & Eat,Restaurant,Marrakech
Dinner with show,suggested by our riad this restaurant has a beautiful setting with colorful tiles typical of royal palaces of marrakesh. The show for tourists starts at 8 am. Fast service and friendly staff. Very hearty dishes also have kid menus and for the 9-year-old we managed to have chicken skewers not too spicy. Very tourist restaurant at tourist prices .they also have alcoholic beverages in the menu Moroccan rosé wine was drinkable. Artists engage guests by asking for tips for the photo.,Dardar Rooftop Cocktails & Eat,Restaurant,Marrakech
Beautiful venue for an evening in Marrakech,"Great place to dine or drink one of their great and scenic cocktails (one of the few places that serves alcohol in Marrakech). 
We just had dinner and ate very well! The restaurant is cool inside (with air conditioning) and boasts a very nice terrace from which to see the city from above and maybe a nice sunset. The food is very good and after dinner you can attend a dancing show. The bartenders are very nice and the waiters very nice!!",Dardar Rooftop Cocktails & Eat,Restaurant,Marrakech
Scam of the century,"What a disappointment! I couldn’t wait to test this place, the setting as well as the food seemed to really stick to an interesting dynamic and a search for taste and pleasure for customers. 

Unfortunately, it is quite the opposite. The quantities are ridiculous, but still this could be compensated by an explosive taste, precise seasoning or a fair balance. Except it’s none of that! Bland, tasteless, flavorless and unbalanced! 
And icing on the cake necessarily the bill! Which hurts extremely considering the experience. 
5€ a bottle of water, for a nice but not crazy setting, a simple service, it gives you an idea! 

I advise against",Dardar Rooftop Cocktails & Eat,Restaurant,Marrakech
Pleasant rooftop experience,"Dardar came highly recommended per the reviews and didn't disappoint although not quite full marks. Rooftop experience was lovely, it positively served wine and beers which we've found to be uncommon in Marrakech and the food was very tasty. It was a little on the pricey side and our group of 6 were placed on a table in the middle sitting on backless chairs which became uncomfortable after a while. Worth a visit but insist on chairs with backs!",Dardar Rooftop Cocktails & Eat,Restaurant,Marrakech
Excellent food and drinks,"We visited for dinner and drinks as a group of friends on holiday.
Our table on the terrace wasn’t quite ready so we headed to the bar for a cocktail. Cocktails were of a really good standard! 
We were then shown to our table. Great service.  We had a mixture of starters and mains between the 8 of us, all of which were fantastic.  Belly dancers came out during dinner and performed, with some audience participation. Overall great service, friendly staff, excellent atmosphere and the food to match!",Dardar Rooftop Cocktails & Eat,Restaurant,Marrakech

Deposit beware,Deposit 51.50 pounds still not refunded despite two emails still no response.

I don’t see why men are forbidden to enter with sandals when in the world it’s normal + it’s 45 degrees in Marrakech so an explanation... I don’t recommend you because if the service and 0 and no respect for the customer It’s no use leaving
There is something else better and top price and pleasant service.",Palais Dar Soukkar,Restaurant,Marrakech
Beautiful from afar but far from beautiful,"The meal is very good as well as the service .. on the other hand, the show is insipid and interspersed by long bands of music ( DJ ) and it is really very loud!
We were outside, it was very hot (no cooling system ) and the lighting on the stage is catastrophic ..",Palais Dar Soukkar,Restaurant,Marrakech

Dar Sukar is a must!,"Booking made for 6 adults for 5 months, deposit paid!
We're coming: what's your name?
We repeat the same name 3 times to the reception staff and we are told: no reservation!
We take out the emails, the evidence and suddenly the revelation .... and the destructive look of the receptionist towards her colleagues who finally found the reservation!
We are seated at a table with bench and chairs from another age, below a platform where groups of young people in more than casual clothing are located while a correct outfit is required on the site of the complex!
Cocktails, choice of menu, wines, ok everything now goes well: I specify to the waiter 3 times that I will taste the wine after my cocktail... he nods... serves me wine... and asks me if it suits me: a joke!
The dishes are of average quality and the service pushes for consumption with the wine bottles that empty quickly!
The show finally begins: singer of good level, fire-breather who does not spit anything... dancers dynamic but of average quality: overall duration of the show of 1 hour, dinner finished, coffee and addition! And there, the room manager asks us to clear the table because we learn that the reservation is scheduled for a duration of 2.5 hours at the table, then we have to get out and either go out, or find a table at the bar!
Little text explanation with the manager, discussion and finally he finds us another table at the bar!
Weird but some tables that arrived at the same time as us, remain in place and are not subject to this rule: we quickly realize that indigenous youth groups are not disturbed: cronies and arrangements?
In short, an evening where the negatives follow with a feeling of not being respected as a customer!
Dar Sukar is a must-see in Marrakech but management and customer relations are not up to the task!
The meals are average, the comfort of the tables and chairs is improved, the show is moderately correct!
All this is sold through social networks and the bling bling highlighted by the establishment!",Palais Dar Soukkar,Restaurant,Marrakech
Totally fantastic evening with dinner and show,"Fantastic evening. Surprisingly top class. Extremely skilled DJs and really professional dancers. Great songs that got the audience. The food was excellent - the best we got in Morocco. Take the “expensive” menu. The price of food and drink is higher than elsewhere, but the atmosphere and the show you get with - and it's all worth the money. Do not arrive before 21/21.30 and stay for far beyond midnight. The mood is far from the tourist, as one could fear. It is full of joy and really professional. The sound is excellent - outside under the open sky with light shows and lamps and cozy. Forgotten service that is also unrivalled. Strong servants who actually knew something about food and wine - and made the evening perfect.",Palais Dar Soukkar,Restaurant,Marrakech
Excellente,It was really an exceptional culinary experience thank you dar soukar a big thank you to our host Khadija for his profenalism welcome and recommendations,Palais Dar Soukkar,Restaurant,Marrakech
"Thank to our waiter, but not a Moroccan night out.","So I would give this 2 reviews… firstly to our waiter - 10/10 THANKYOU👏🏻🌟🤩
Our daughter suddenly, as soon as we ordered, was overcome with heat stroke. This waiter - I wish I had got his name - could not have done more to help us, bringing ice in a napkin, medicine, letting her lie down a different area, thank you again for your kindness❤️
My second review is for the experience of Dar Soukkar - it was elegant, the setting was a spectacle, the food good, the service excellent but it wasn’t 100 per cent a Moroccan experience. The belly dancers were very good, but some of the other entertainment choices I would think would appeal more to young boujee phone scrolling 20 something locals. For us to hear Adele or Amy Winehouse songs or see Chicago dance routines.. not so much… we can see that at home. So if you are looking for a truly Moroccan Marrakesh night out I would probably look elsewhere.",Palais Dar Soukkar,Restaurant,Marrakech
Best experience!!,Best experience in Marrakech for dinner and amazing shows. Singer and performance was great. Food & service was very good.,Palais Dar Soukkar,Restaurant,Marrakech
A mediocre experience despite the festive setting,"We had a great time overall thanks to the festive atmosphere and the impressive setting of the Dar Sukkar Palace. However, several points really marred the experience.

The food is correct, without more, certainly not at the level of prices charged. I found a piece of plastic in my dessert, but the waiter was in such a hurry to clear it that I didn’t even have time to report it.

Barely the last bite swallowed, we were brought the bill without even wondering if we wanted to have something else to drink. Two minutes after paying, a staff member arrived, accompanied by a couple, to ask us to clear the table. No words of apology, just an injunction to ""go to the bar"".

We stayed 1h20 in all. Being in a hurry to leave the table after spending nearly €180 on two people is quite shocking. Too bad, because the place has potential, but the purely commercial approach spoils the experience.",Palais Dar Soukkar,Restaurant,Marrakech
A good night with mehdi,"We had a beautiful night at dar soukkar its was amazing day with the waiter mehdi he was carful and take care about us all the night the show was great, food was delicious ❤️",Palais Dar Soukkar,Restaurant,Marrakech
We spent a wonderful evening at Dar Soukkar as a family,"We spent a wonderful evening at Dar Soukkar as a family, and it truly felt like a special occasion from the moment we arrived. The setting is breathtaking — a beautifully restored old sugar palace with grand architecture, candlelight, and lush gardens that make you feel like you’ve stepped into a Moroccan fairytale.

We chose it for a family dinner, and it didn’t disappoint. The atmosphere was elegant but still relaxed enough for us to enjoy with kids. The food was delicious — we shared a variety of Moroccan dishes, and everything was flavorful and beautifully presented. The lamb tagine and briouates were especially memorable.

As the evening went on, the live music and traditional performances added even more magic to the night. It was a perfect blend of culture, fine dining, and ambiance.

The service was professional and attentive, making us feel welcome and well taken care of from start to finish.

Dar Soukkar is the kind of place you go to when you want the full Marrakech experience — dinner, history, music, and beauty all in one.",Palais Dar Soukkar,Restaurant,Marrakech

We do like our cocktails and these were the most creative, inspired fun and delicious too. The Churchill is an amazing invention - how it was done, we've no idea.

We had tapas as well - and they were perfect and creatively displayed too.

The staff were friendly and efficient.

And the Ladies - well, I've never smiled so much when visiting a bathroom.

Thank you so much Baromètre for a fantastic experience.",Baromètre Marrakech,Restaurant,Marrakech

A creative and inviting culinary and cock tailexperience in Marrakesh!,"If you're looking for an exceptional dining experience in a speakeasy atmosphere, look no further Barometre. Nestled just a short 10-minute taxi ride from the Medina.

The star of the show is the incredibly creative mixologist. With hundreds of bitters and blends at their disposal, the cocktail menu is a playground. Each drink is a masterpiece, not just in flavor but also in presentation. The artistry involved in crafting these cocktails is impressive.

My daughter and I started our meal with some delicious starters. The olive tree was colorful presentation, we paired with a rich beet hummus and a the avocado pellet salad. For our entrée, we chose the Asian beef, and it did not disappoint. The beef was flavorful, tender, and simply yummy. Each dish was beautifully presented, showcasing the chef’s creativity and attention to detail.  Service  was outstanding—our server was incredibly attentive and offered many great suggestions.",Baromètre Marrakech,Restaurant,Marrakech

Transported to the heights of the medina and gastronomy.,"My last visit was once again more exceptional than the others. we were a little afraid with our friends of the heat for lunch, but finally everything went well thanks to the Mist which refreshes much the ambient area. From reception to service everything was impeccable, you feel the 18 years of experience to make the customer travel. A good part of Moroccan cuisine is represented and fortunately there is also international cuisine which allowed my friends to change a little because they needed it, while staying in a beautiful setting reminiscent of the terraces of the Riads.",Terrasse des Epices,Restaurant,Marrakech
The perfect rooftop bar.,"From the moment we walked in the service was positive and welcoming. It was 44 degrees, but with water vapour and a bit of a breeze - and the constant topping up of drinks with ice, we were comfortable. The music entertainment added to the atmosphere without being intrusive. . The food is beautifully presented - and whilst not cheap for Marrakech, ceratinly wasn't expensive. Particular thanks to our very attentive waiter,  Haben. So much better than the nearby Cafe Arabe, which we visted just before!",Terrasse des Epices,Restaurant,Marrakech
Great.,Great atmosphere we arrived in Marrakech for the first time we arrived late from the airport we had a great drink great atmosphere our holidays how there at that time we had not eaten we were offered excellent tapas,Terrasse des Epices,Restaurant,Marrakech
Good for lunch,We ended up having and unexpected lunch here after we finished our sightseeing tour of the medina. View is nice. Service attentive but a bit overpriced when it comes to food and drinks. Barely seen any local. Just tourists.,Terrasse des Epices,Restaurant,Marrakech
a magical moment in the heart of the medina,"What a beautiful discovery! The Terrace of Spices is a haven of peace above the bustle of the medina. The setting is beautiful, with breathtaking views of the rooftops of Marrakech and the Atlas Mountains in the distance. The atmosphere is both chic and casual, perfect for a family dinner

The service was impeccable: smiling, attentive and professional from start to finish. We tasted several revisited Moroccan dishes, all delicious and perfectly presented. Special mention for lamb tagine — a real delight!

A big congratulations to the whole team for this beautiful experience. We will definitely return during our next stay in Marrakech!",Terrasse des Epices,Restaurant,Marrakech

Birthday party,"Booked online for my birthday, the whole team was kind and caring for us...the excellent meal with sought after flavors, very good wine and the terrace is beautifully decorated, no sure view but so cozy...a top music band, could not be more romantic. My favorite place in the Medina, a security guard will accompany you to your Riad in the late evening, Bravo",Terrasse des Epices,Restaurant,Marrakech
Worst choice,"I booked a table for me and my boyfriend at 18:30, with the intent of drinking something cool on a rooftop that has little and nothing, except the lack of the roof; we were the first customers to access and they made us sit in the center, between black walls and empty tables, despite the “best” tables were empty. We are provided with menus and we opted for a spritz and a beer (being 18:30), specific that we are Italian, drinks arrive and we are asked if we wanted food, but cordially we say no, having a dinner planned elsewhere; 30 minutes pass and again the waiter comes to urge us to take food, which honestly we do not want, he emphasizes, with an air of conceit and a smile on his face, that the consumption is mandatory; very irritated by the ways we take two tapas, once arrived, my boyfriend wanted to get up and leave, without consuming them, irritated by the behavior of the waiter who treated us like waste that could not afford to eat there and for the failure to communicate this 'obligatory expected consumption' but I urged him to stay; they were about to start the evening with the musician, but just finished the food we wanted to leave, we could not wait. In summary I can say that the waiters make an assessment of customers based on what they wear and treat them differently, the prices are high, exaggeratedly for the place where it is located (terrace with black walls, you can not see anything if they put you in the center) , the food is nothing big, all presentation and scene, common flavor, spritz stretched with water. I honestly advise against it, no plus points. I have to put a star on it, but it deserves zero.",Terrasse des Epices,Restaurant,Marrakech
Pass your way,"Where to start...  Dinner one evening in June, with two, we think ""The Terrace of Spices"", it's famous, we should have a good evening...! Hop, I reserve, because the place is stormed so much it is THE PLACE TO BE! 
Arrived at 21:45 (only possible slot for reservation), the restaurant is half empty. Crazy. 
Very nice little live music. Friendly and welcoming staff. 
We are offered the map and LA: surprise!!! we are in Saint Tropez! Exorbitant prices! Well it must be really delicious, typical, authentic, who cares to pay for an amazing rooftop experience with a view (I'm still looking for it), right? 
The dishes are coming. Interest-free dishes. Tourist food! In a well-Europeanized place when we just want to be in Marrakech! Because restaurants like this, I have tons where I live. 
It annoys me that people are laughing! In Marrakech, we want softness, human warmth, we want the typical, we want the authentic, we want to forget that guineaty side that we see everywhere! 
Visitor advice: spend your money elsewhere.",Terrasse des Epices,Restaurant,Marrakech
Just excellent. Best in the city,Never sure what to expect but this was just excellent in every way. Interesting menu and proof That you get what you pay for and to be fair you do pay quite a bit here. Service and food first class in every respect. The waiter had the measure of us and balanced humour with professionalism. Portions more than adequate. Long wine list (not so everywhere in Morocco of course). Interesting dishes on the extensive menu and caters for veg/gf etc. will be back,Terrasse des Epices,Restaurant,Marrakech
"Great service, cool ambience and fine food","A great location, live music, evening sun, fine food and nice service. We would go back there. Make sure to reserve in advance!",Terrasse des Epices,Restaurant,Marrakech
Pleasant,"A very nice terrace, but with no great views around. Usually full, there is a need to reserve, has shifts, which implies terms to eat with some hurry to give room to the next.
Friendly and efficient staff, live music but international.
It’s a very nice place in the middle of the medina, but it’s more European than truly Moroccan, which doesn’t mean it’s not a place to visit.
The food is good but I think the prices are too high and the wine is not even spoken.",Terrasse des Epices,Restaurant,Marrakech
Pricey terrace view,"We came in for lunch. The staff were friendly- no complaints there. We ordered 3 small starters, a bottle of sparkling water and two ice creams (two scoops each). It came out to $88. The food was good but nothing spectacular. I understand that catering to Western clientele, and paying for a nice (but not spectacular) view. If you don't mind overpaying - it is a good place. But you can get better food for a lot less.",Terrasse des Epices,Restaurant,Marrakech
Beautiful restaurant,"food, excellent service --> recommended!
I ate dinner at the Terrasse des Spices one evening but and I am happy to recommend it! I started with very nice salads and really delicious olives (much better than many!) .

I very much appreciated that the restaurant offers the possibility to be escorted, free of charge (tips are welcome) to its accommodation after dinner. Good evening.",Terrasse des Epices,Restaurant,Marrakech
A Peaceful Culinary Escape in a Historic Riad,"Dining at Restaurant Dar Cherifa was a truly special experience. Set inside a beautifully restored 16th-century riad, the ambiance is serene, elegant, and full of charm. It's the kind of place that makes you slow down and soak in the beauty of Marrakech’s history and architecture.

The menu offers a refined take on traditional Moroccan dishes. We tried the chicken tagine with preserved lemon and olives, and it was absolutely delicious — tender, flavorful, and beautifully presented. The desserts and fresh juices were also a highlight.

The staff were welcoming and professional, striking the perfect balance between attentive and discreet. Whether you're coming for lunch, dinner, or just tea under the lanterns, Dar Cherifa is a hidden gem you shouldn't miss.",Restaurant Dar Cherifa,Restaurant,Marrakech
Magic,"Unique atmosphere in this typical Moroccan restaurant inside a Riad.
Attentive and kind service.
Authentic, good and hearty dishes.
The price is certainly higher than what you can find in other restaurants in Marrakech, but the atmosphere, service and quality of what you eat are worth every last Dirham.
Particularly the fact that you eat among the paintings of emerging Moroccan artists and that the same paintings, if you want, you can buy.",Restaurant Dar Cherifa,Restaurant,Marrakech

We were delighted by the quality of the cuisine... the pastilla is top. An incredible dessert, with a perfect balance of spices and sweetness: eggplant crumble. 
I highly recommend",Restaurant Dar Cherifa,Restaurant,Marrakech
Great architecture with great food,"We booked it through our riad on the same day we visited the restaurant. Quiet place to enjoy food in a beautiful building - definitely worth visiting if you're an architecture lover. We were one of the last guests, so we ate peacefully, with delicious food. They have in the menu camel meatballs, which I haven't seen in many other restaurants.",Restaurant Dar Cherifa,Restaurant,Marrakech
Super,"A particularly beautiful, quiet place, with extremely friendly staff, with a very tasty local menu.Harder to find among the narrow streets of the old town, but worth the effort to find it.",Restaurant Dar Cherifa,Restaurant,Marrakech
beautiful local experience at Dar Cherifa,"The welcome was incredibly warm! We were a group of 12 and a small corner had been specially arranged for us, which really made the moment pleasant. The dishes were in line with our expectations, delicious and well presented.

At the end of the meal, we unfortunately dropped a small exhibit on site, but the team showed patience and understanding, a real plus. Only small downside: the waiting time to get our change back was a bit long but we remain honest.

It remains a very nice place, typical, where you eat very well (not everyone liked the dessert but it was atypical a bit sweet). A local address that I recommend to live a beautiful Moroccan experience.",Restaurant Dar Cherifa,Restaurant,Marrakech

Entering through an unassuming door, you step into a true fairytale—not an artificial, touristy Disneyland, but a genuine gallery of art and architecture. It’s the perfect spot for a romantic dinner. And a brilliant introduction to Moroccan cuisine—thankfully, the well-curated menu is the best guide. Bravo!",Restaurant Dar Cherifa,Restaurant,Marrakech
Authentic Moroccan experience,The staff at this hotel are so attentive. All your requests and needs are met immediately. The rooms are large and decorated in authentic traditional Moroccan style. At first getting to your room is like being in a maze with so many courtyards and corridors but you soon find your way. Very private and no outside noise except you can hear the birds singing. The breakfast and afternoon tea are very refreshing. Two restaurants on site if you arrive jet lagged you don’t have to go out. All in all a wonderful experience and I would stay there again.

A must-see in Marrakech,"Very good workshop! We cooked 2 types DE sala DE Moroccans (taktouka and courgettes), a fish tagine, and an almond and orange blossom pastilla. Very good menu that shows the techniques to use to cook a Tajine. We learned a lot DE Moroccan cuisine (not just these dishes). DE addition, it is a wonderful human experience: Naila and Dada are incredibly kind. It’s a perfect course for all levels, then eating the final product in the beautiful dining room is a sublime experience.",La Maison Arabe,Restaurant,Marrakech
Magical Marrakech,"We not only had a wonderful experience at your hotel but your city was amazing. The La Maison Arabe property is very lovely. The spa was under renovation but we had a beautiful experience nonetheless. Each room and nook were beautifully decorated all very traditional and welcoming. We loved wandering through on the way to the piano jazz bar. What an absolute treat to have such talented musicians every night !! The bartenders made exceptionally crafted drinks. We enjoyed many nights at the lounge. Also that cinnamon smell radiating when you walk in reception was yummy. The staff…
All the staff that we encounter were absolutely amazing. They went out of their way to make us feel welcomed and they were so very accommodating to our needs. They truly are the reason we would recommend the hotel and come back to stay. We truly feel they were exceptional. 
The cooking class was outstanding! 
The 3 hours flew by. We all agreed that the cooking experience was the best of all our activities that we scheduled for our entire stay. Walking distance from the markets and Bahia Palace as well as the Saadian Tombs",La Maison Arabe,Restaurant,Marrakech
Magical stay in this historic hotel.,"Incredible stay at the hotel. The grounds of this historic hotel can’t be matched. The staff is so incredibly warm, kind, and knowledgeable.

Second visit to this wonderful hotel.,"La Maison Arabe is an excellent and peaceful hotel in a very good location for exploring the Medina and also further afield; we walked to the Jardin Majorelle and Gueliz in less than thirty minutes.
The hotel rooms and public spaces are beautifully decorated in traditional Moroccan style and everything is very clean and well maintained. 
The hotel's country club is a great facility just outside the city, great place to go in the afternoon heat to enjoy the pool and relax. 
The food is great, the breakfast buffet has a very wide choice and the restaurant in the evening has an excellent menu and very interesting wine list featuring mainly Moroccan wines, which we rate highly.  We also enjoyed the roof top bar for more casual dining. 
Although we find everything about this hotel to be excellent, the most impressive aspect of La Maison Arabe is definitely its staff. They could not be any more helpful or friendly, they are a real asset to the hotel.
This was our second visit to this wonderful hotel, and we will definitely return.",La Maison Arabe,Restaurant,Marrakech
The absolute best!,"I can’t say enough about Maison Arabe. I have had the great fortune of traveling and it’s the most wonderful, magical place I’ve ever stayed. The staff is exemplary!!! The food is amazing. My only disappointment is the pool was closed and we learned having dinner there is highly recommended. I can’t say enough about the staff! I felt like a princess. In fact, I get choked up thinking about how kind everyone was. A special thanks to Hakim, Redwane, the bar tender and another gentleman who also worked at the front desk. Everyone was special!! I hope to return one day!",La Maison Arabe,Restaurant,Marrakech
"Luxurious, authentic and historic.","We were very pleasantly surprised by La Maison Arabe, when booking we didn't study it much but the service was 5* from the moment we booked. The hotel refunded us for an extra day we accidentally booked which was very kind. They knew I'd recently been in a traffic accident in the UK so they organised a 4x4 car to pick us up from the airport for free. The team were highly professional and warm spirited throughout our stay. They helped us organise trips, taxis and offered daily advice. Our room was immaculate, opulent yet homely and felt luxurious. I've tried to recreate our stay at home by buying orange blossom essence, brass hooks and towel robes :)

The hotel has a jazz piano bar and lots of history too. I think Winston Churchill was a frequent visitor. 

As someone who cannot eat gluten or dairy I often find hotel breakfast difficult. However the food was great! I had almond milk in my coffee and plenty of options for food; omelette, fresh figs, fresh beetroot juice, savoury options, fruit, quinoa and more. 

At the time of visiting the pool was under construction so the hotel had an hourly shuttle which took us to their second private property which has a fabulous luxury outdoor pool set in hectors of gardens and in a beautiful setting. I would have liked to have known about this before arriving, but they certainly redeemed themselves. 

My only criticism was that one of the taxis they booked us during the week didn't have seatbelts, but perhaps they didn't know that when booking. And, that the fallback pool didn't serve alcohol like the hotel did. But the lunch we ordered was delicious. 

The hotel is very well located and we mostly walked everyday to our destinations. On arrival we booked a walking tour which was such a great idea as we saw so much of the local area and the guide over indexed on the arts which is our passion. 

I'd definitely return here again!",La Maison Arabe,Restaurant,Marrakech

Amazing Staff and Experiences,"Overall, the staff at Sofitel are incredible.

Farah, Karim, Khalid, and Mustafa are just a few of the people who greet you with a smile and make sure you have a table and meal as you like it. The experiences at the pools were special, too. The staff is exceptional here and working in the hot sun did not prevent them from keeping us comfortable. Wassif and Abaayous (sp?) will provide you with water, towels, drinks, and snacks. Tip them well as they work hard! The dinner dining experience at the hotel's restaurant is lovely. I enjoyed sitting on the patio and listening to the band, a very talented group having the perfect set of songs while dining. The food is delicious and offers both Moroccan and French menus. The staff Wiaam, Kebir, and Hicham were always friendly and attentive to our needs.  And Hanane made an effort to remember exactly how I like my salad and make sure the chef prepared it my way!

Chilled vibes and amazing food,"We thought we'd try this restaurant after reading the reviews on Trip Advisor and we were blown away by the amazing food and friendly service.
The restaurant is on the main street Riad Zitoun el Jadid, leading to the main square. We were staying nearby so it was an easy walk. 
My daughter ordered the Maffe Beouf which she said was really tender and lean, there was a peanut sauce underneath and it was served with rice. I had the Yassa Poulet which although I'm not mad about chicken on the bone, was so tender it literally fell apart. The onions were very sweet and absolutely delicious. They don't serve alcohol but my daughter said banana smoothie was one of the best she'd ever had, I had lemon schwepps. We ordered a bottle of water then two coffees and shared an enormous slice of gooey chocolate brownie which was absolute heaven. The atmosphere was chilled with some great music playing in the background and the young serving staff were friendly and attentive. We thoroughly enjoyed our meal and wish we'd had time to visit again, all the above came to about £42.00 worth every penny.",BlackChich,Restaurant,Marrakech

Beautiful setting, staff with little care explanations of dishes and superb cuisine, it is a treat.( Moroccan cuisine)

Oasis of serenity in the alleys of the Medina,"We stopped by Corner Cafè by chance and were pleasantly surprised. The restaurant is small and secluded and despite being in the middle of the alleys of the Medina, it is like a small oasis of peace and tranquility.

NOMAD,"Again at Nomad, we are loyal to this restaurant where we are never disappointed.
EN viro DE la scientifique, the staff will do their utmost to ensure that you are not too exposed to the sun. The map is always well realized and the view always beautiful. We love this place which we highly recommend.",NOMAD,Restaurant,Marrakech
Friendly rooftop restaurant with disappointing food,"Sunset dinner , Polite and friendly staff comfortable seating area on the terrace with partial views over the market square below but mostly roof tops were the only good things about this restaurant. We ate zucchini fritters  and beetroot and goats cheese salad to start which were edible but uninspired and for mains the worst marinated grilled chicken we had in a long time, dry  tough and tasteless. The accompanying roasted carrots were nice as were the French beans . There was no sauce and overall a very boring dish poorly executed. We didn’t stay for dessert. 82 euro including water and a couple of non alcoholic beers each , there must be a lot better than this in Marrakech.",NOMAD,Restaurant,Marrakech
Rooftop dinner,"The worst restaurant experience in Marrakech 
A burger for almost 20 euros with industrial bread and 3 potatoes fighting in a duel , a lentil salad without taste or seasoning and dry bread, not fresh 
FUYEZ!!!!",NOMAD,Restaurant,Marrakech
A moment suspended!,"The place is great for its area in the square , the terrace very well to have a nice time, but when they put the water through your nose and charge you at 4 € it starts to anger you, we order dinner for 3, 90 €, the menu with little variety, we order burger 17 €, simple without extra ingredients, total disappointment, and chicken with white curries, meaning chicken with cream and green beans, we did not understand, in short do not go, there are better and much cheaper places",NOMAD,Restaurant,Marrakech
Great food - Great location - Great service,"The rooftop terrace is lovely and music and ambiance are great. Amazing sunset views and nice breeze. Food is ok, nothing special..not worth the price for us but Location and service were excellent so that was worth it. We are vegetarian and both the 2 vegetarians mains weren't available. We ended up ordering the 4 vegetarian appetizers which were good but 3 of them were salads so all kind of the same. A shame as I was looking forward to the cauliflower but it wasn't available. It was very busy so definitely a popular spot,  we just got a bit unlucky with the unavailable dishes.",NOMAD,Restaurant,Marrakech
"Cozy rooftop with great food, but could be better","Professional welcome , magical place, clean , dishes dosed with great finesse, we feasted with a fish tagine and a crisp monkfish with a sauce that the taste buds remember! 
Excellent desserts. 
A very pleasant moment",NOMAD,Restaurant,Marrakech

Incredible sorbet!,Great staff. Fantastic location in the medina. We sat on rooftop which had views of the city and sunset. Food was really good. Well worth the visit,NOMAD,Restaurant,Marrakech
Not worth it,"Beautiful place for dinner. 
We had the monkfish (which was amazing. The sauce was to die for! My partner thought it was the best dish of the holiday). 
We also had the curried chicken which was tasty. 
Overall the staff were lovely and we had a great dinner. 
We found the seating to be a little tight however with it being very busy",NOMAD,Restaurant,Marrakech
Roof top expensive paid,"We stopped in because the sorbet sounded really good. Turns out, it was amazing! It comes with two scoops. We ordered the same two scoops, Berber tea, and raspberry Moroccan rose. While we both loved both flavors, my wife preferred the Berber tea. Meanwhile, I absolutely loved the raspberry Moroccan rose. We are returning tomorrow!",NOMAD,Restaurant,Marrakech
Beautiful sunset,"I wouldn’t come back, as there is a lot of dining in Marrakech at much lower prices. They didn’t have several of the dishes on the menu, already not too long. On the upside, the food was good and the place is nice.",NOMAD,Restaurant,Marrakech
Fruit and other cocktails,"A nice and beautifully decorated rooftop, modern cuisine, high prices compared to other restaurants of the same ""standing""",NOMAD,Restaurant,Marrakech

Staff was ok.",Le Jardin,Restaurant,Marrakech
The garden,"Why not have lunch in the shade DE the vegetation! Well in this restaurant ""Le jardin"" it is possible under a lemon or fig tree, the place is beautiful! 
We are not surprised when we know that this establishment belongs to the DADA group (nomadic, spice coffee etc...). The cuisine is tasty and the calm DE the place is interesting. Braised tomato soup, garden grilla DES, couscous, zucchini fritters, fresh cucumber cheese are extraordinary. I recommend this cocoon!",Le Jardin,Restaurant,Marrakech

Very nice and cheap place - GO,Very nice rooftop overlooking the market and the other roofs. The staff is super friendly. The food is very good quality and everything is very cheap.,Le Jardin,Restaurant,Marrakech
A calm oasis,"We were a group of 12 who enjoyed lunch downstairs in the garden area.  Staff were friendly and knowledgeable and everyone enjoyed the delicious food.  The setting is calm and peaceful after the buzz of the souk just outside the entrance.  Prices were reasonable and portions adequate.
Our only complaint was the booking process (usually necessary for a downstairs table, although you can walk in for the upper levels which are just as pretty when we ate there last year).  Having to send a bank transfer as deposit was a costly endeavour for us (as we dont have paypal) and we felt other options like giving credit card details should have been adequate like many other cities accept.
However, on the day, it was an enjoyable experience and I would recommend it while in Marrakech.",Le Jardin,Restaurant,Marrakech
An oasis in the Medina,"A cool oasis in the middle of the Medina! We stayed for lunch, varied and delicious food, rabbit at all! average price",Le Jardin,Restaurant,Marrakech
Disappointment,"We were on the rooftop. Very very hot... disappointed by our meal, composed of patatas bravas (not bad) but the plate of grills was very dry.",Le Jardin,Restaurant,Marrakech
Great place for lunch or dinner,"Very good food and service, great place to have lunch with very fair prices, highly recommended! We went twice, we recommend the octopus",Le Jardin,Restaurant,Marrakech
Nice setting but too touristy,"Restaurant very touristic... it took battle to have our table we had booked online, but apparently they do not take into account these reservations...Hospitable staff, especially Maryam who is adorable! 
For the setting, I would say very green, but not at all soothing since we were treated to the work with the jackhammers right next door. And also the music is too loud... At the level of dishes, we really liked the different flavors.",Le Jardin,Restaurant,Marrakech
Poor.,"Bad food, really rude staff. Despite the booking they made us wait more than an hour, passing people without reservations. To be in Marrakech is also a very expensive restaurant",Le Jardin,Restaurant,Marrakech
Casual atmosphere and warm welcome,"Excellent welcome... nice relaxed atmosphere.... cuisine with excellent flavors... tajine and delicious couscous 
And especially a service in kindness and smiles of Hasnaa that allowed us to savor even more this moment",Le Jardin,Restaurant,Marrakech
Service to review and fresh juice to improve,"We had lunch in the garden for the second time and were disappointed by the service on a part that was a bit long 
Fresh juices are not good and not fresh enough!
You can do better...,
The place remains beautiful and the dishes good and correct in price.
In the end we wanted to pay in euros and a young girl refused 50 euro notes because supposedly damaged... in short elsewhere we did not have this problem!!!!",Le Jardin,Restaurant,Marrakech

Unforgettable honeymoon with great food and amazing staff!,"We had a fantastic honeymoon here. If you're looking for an all-inclusive right in the middle of a city, this is the place to go. You'll be pampered by all the staff, fun activities are organized, the food is amazing, and the staff are incredibly friendly.

And if you want the best cocktails, make sure to visit Hamza and Abderahmane. Wow, such great guys and their cocktails are truly the best in the resort!

Thank you to everyone at TUI Medina Gardens for an unforgettable week.",TUI BLUE Medina Gardens,Tourist+Attraction,Marrakech
Shocking decline in the space of 12 months,"We came back to Medina gardens for the second year in a row, having had such an amazing time last year. The 2 experiences couldn’t have been further apart. 

The air conditioning in the room was all but useless, even after having it on all night the temperate was still 21-22 degrees, with 40 degree plus heat outside it was extremely uncomfortable and difficult to sleep. We spoke to reception, someone came to clean the filter, which was absolutely filthy, but it made no difference. 

We purchased day beds so we could have some shade. On the Sunday, the beds by the main pool were all booked so we booked a bed by the relax pool. When we got to the bed, not only was it completely broken but there were no cushions on it. The bed was broken in the middle so both sides tilted towards the middle, the back section was completely broken off so we had nothing to lean up against. When we spoke to the lifeguard and asked for some cushions, he told us they were in the laundry. 

Upon check out we told the receptionist we didn’t use the bed on Sunday and asked them to remove it. I then had to wait over 30 mins on our last day for the manager to seek out the lifeguard and ask him. She then came back and told me they could not remove it from my charge as we didn’t let them know on the day and that it had already been charged to my room. We had booked a bed for the final day, so I asked if that could be refunded, the manager agreed, I paid the bill. 

Twenty minutes later the same manager came out to the pool to our bed and told me we had to pay for the bed! I refused. 

Service in the main restaurant was slow and poor, as was the food. 

We paid for a jacuzzi for our balcony; hardly any of the jets worked, the plastic surround was tatty and dirty, we only used it once. 

The WiFi was shocking. At least 50% of our stay we had none. It kept going in and out which was frustrating when you’re trying to listen to music or an audiobook by the pool. 

The resort wreaks of cost cutting and is no longer a premium facility. 

The only positive was the service of the guys making cocktails in ‘the bar’ they were brilliant, so friendly and excellent service. 

Needless to say we will not be returning next year.",TUI BLUE Medina Gardens,Tourist+Attraction,Marrakech
"Beautiful, clean, friendly hotel.",Third time here but first time during Summer as usually come for New Year's Eve. Staff are friendly and helpful. They really do want you to enjoy your time. Food is excellent with great selection and very fresh. I did email hotel 3 times over a 4 month period before arriving in order to request room upgrade but never had response. Our room experience has got worse each time we come here.  Another thing to note is we asked for late check out and paid for this but was only given one option till 6pm. When looking on app we saw we could have checked out 2 hours earlier (which fitted with our flight) and it would have been cheaper. We did tell reception and they apologised. Entertainment staff seem to be enjoying themselves but could have done more to involve people during Entertainment nights. We feel this was much better at new year.  There is unfortunately the same age old issue of the reserving sunbeds at crack of dawn which is a pain and have seen this done so much better at other hotels with app reservations etc. The one morning that the sunbed policy was followed through was much better to avoid the sunbed hoggers who leave the towel and disappear back to bed etc.  Overall this is a beautiful hotel with very hard working friendly staff and we will most likely return again in the future.,TUI BLUE Medina Gardens,Tourist+Attraction,Marrakech
An amazing two weeks away.,"Just back from our fourth stay here and it just gets better each year. 
Hotel is in a perfect position for exploring the souks and riads and a very short taxi ride to some of Marrakech’s best spots such as plus61 restaurant or Al Fassia Aguedal. 

We knew that there had been a change of manager this year and with that some staff changes, so wondered if it would have the same family ran feeling, but there were no issues at all. In fact the whole team were incredible. 
From Chef Said and his hard working squad delivering amazing quality hotel food (wait til you see the desserts!) to Aazzedine and Fatima 🥰 looking after us superbly. They have all been here years now and are an example to all in terms of service, politeness and friendliness. 
I swam every morning and called in to the restaurant for a coffee before going back to the room and the daily greeting from Abdullah is worth coming back here alone. Top top guy. 
Moroccan hospitality takes some beating, and this goes for outside of the hotel environment too, but if this hotel lacks in any 5star refinery then it’s made up for in spades by the people. 
From the warm welcome by Abir, Chawki and the management team after a late arrival, to the great service by the pool bar squad including Abdulwahid and Reda, topped off by the best bar staff in the city in Ahmed, Mohamed and Omar. 
There have been changes to the nightly entertainment, not something we’re huge on, but definitely better, and overall lots of little improvements around the whole hotel which are noticeable. There are even a peacock and hen wandering the superbly kept gardens now, which is a strange sight at first but really adds to the character of the place. 
Padel courts, a heated quiet pool for laps and a great gym keeps you in cake credit (you’ll need it), but if you just want to come away to switch off, enjoy some glorious uninterrupted sunshine with only a 15 minute airport transfer then this is the spot. ( RAK airport was great this year too, so it looks like they have addressed the queuing complaints)
There are so many amazing places to visit in the city and using Medina Gardens as a base is perfect. 
Trips to the secret garden, El Fenn, Kabana, Nobu are all within walking distance and Majorelle area with shops and museums is a 5 minute taxi trip.  Just beware of using InDrive as an uber alternative. Some of the drivers are lunatics! Better to pay the local taxis a bit more for a safer, more enjoyable trip. 
Not sure there’s much more to add and sorry if I’ve missed anyone out but I’m really struggling to think of anything negative to say. 
I miss lazing in the pool with the city sounds and the call to prayer floating over the garden walls. 
My wife and I will definitely be returning a fifth time.",TUI BLUE Medina Gardens,Tourist+Attraction,Marrakech
Another Excellent Stay,"This hotel is serene relaxing and stress free with immaculate grounds comfortable and clean rooms and beautiful sunshine. The hotel is in a great location to explore Marrakech.
My husband and I have recently returned from our third visit to Medina Gardens and it continues to amaze me how in the middle of a city the beautiful gardens and the hotel are so peaceful and relaxing. Both pools are of a temperature that you can get straight in and swim and are of a size that they do not get overcrowded.
The restaurant serves a variety of different foods and they are not the same every night as there are different themes.  The head chef Said serves up delectable delights every night and would give Gordon Ramsey a run for his money.
All the staff are amazing and cannot do enough for you to make your stay memorable.  The pool bar staff led by Mustafa and assisted by cheeky boy Reda, Bada and Omar are contantly walking around the hotel grounds with drinks for the guests and they also remember your favourite tipple.  The restaurant servers Fatima and Armin are quick to fill your drinks glass and clear your table and are friendly polite and professional and nothing is too much trouble for them. Abdula the restaurant cleaner is constantly on the go keeping the restaurant clean and hygeinic.  The restaurant manager Chawki who is new to the hotel and had only joined the staff 2 days before we arrived goes above and beyond with his excellent hospitality. The reception I only visited to change currency and the staff member Moad was extreamly helpful and engaging.
The Tui rep Zenib is very knowledly if you have any questions about places to visit and she does not just sell trips if they are not  suitable and she is always on site at the time her notice states.  And last but not least the owner of the hotel Hassan who also comes on site most days and speaks to the quests to make sure eveything is going well.  The hotel has 24 hour security and the head guard Hassan keeps everyone safe.
I have travelled to many countries and only once in Thailand returned to the same hotel, but for a short flight, a beautiful hotel and grounds, relaxation, excellent food, amazing staff this for me is a hotel I can visit time and time again. We will be back for a forth visit",TUI BLUE Medina Gardens,Tourist+Attraction,Marrakech
Good Stay At TUI BLUE Medina Gardens,"My wife & I have just returned from a two week stay at TUI BLUE Medina Gardens. Flying time was three hours five minutes from Bristol and Transfer time to the hotel was twenty minutes or so. We arrived at 21:30 but the restaurant remained open for our evening meal. During check-in you are fitted with your AI wristband.
 
We booked a jacuzzi room and were shown to room 2004.  The bed was large and comfortable - air conditioning worked well and was not noisy. Sleep quality was good although we heard loud music 01:20 one morning but didn't know the source.  Room servicing by the household staff was excellent!    I requested extra coat hangers via the Tui blue app - you can make maintenance and housekeeping requests via the app.
 
Wi-Fi - this was free and good within the hotel buildings but was patchy in the garden area.

Money exchange - change your GB pounds to Dirams in reception - we got and exchange rate of 11.8 to the pound. Don't take Dirams home - it's a closed currency. There is a charity box at the airport .

Pools - we used the quiet pool or the surrounding garden area during our our stay as the main pool was loud and busy.  Reserving of sunbeds is supposed to be against the rules but everyone did it.   Depth was 1.5M all areas .Get pool towels from the towel hut with your blue card.  Towels can be well used but are okay.

There is no drinks service at the quiet pool - you need to walk to the main pool bar for drinks or coffee. Nearest toilets were behind the Culinarium restaurant.

Food - we booked one evening meal at the Culinarium via the Tui Blue App - It wouldn't let us book again during our second week as it says one booking only via the app. We found the Culinarium okay but didn't worry about visiting again as we thought the main restaurant was much better for variety. We didn't use the Culinarium lunchtime for the same reason.

The Restaurant is the main place we ate all our meals - Breakfast was very good for choice with live cooking stations for eggs / omelettes etc. Staff were quick to serve Tea or coffee and clearing the used plates . Juices and various fruits available.

Evening meals at The Restaurant are themed - International , Moroccan,  Indian and seafood to name a few. No dress code is in operation here. Choices again are wide and varied. Fish was always available usually at the live cooking stations- The tagines were always worth a look as they contained meats , fish or vegetables cooked with preserved lemons.   Staff serving wines and water were prompt to ask you what you wanted to drink - All the wines including red, rose ,white and Prosecco were very drinkable.  Bottled or draught beer was good too. There was live music, violin and Moroccan, here some evenings too which was nice to listen to as you ate your meal.

Bar - the main bar and the Piano bar are nice and air conditioned, ( lovely when outside it was 40 degrees) although the piano person only appeared a couple of times a week we really enjoyed listening to him .  Service was good here as were the gin & tonics. AI Cocktails are available - the Pina coladas were very nice.

Entertainment - some nights a quiz or musical bingo was available at 21:00 before the main show at 21:45 in the fountain bar. These acts were mostly good. Bar service was ok. Shows include Moroccan show, live music or live act with belly dancers with fire!

Tours - we booked the 09:30 half day historical tour costing approx £30 each - this included a guide and coach - we visited the mosque you see and hear from the hotel (not inside) - we were then taken to the rear of our hotel (dropped behind the wall at the back of the Padel court to continue on foot)  We then walked through the arch across the road to enter the souks (no stopping to look at the stalls)  to visit  Medersa Ben Youssef Marrakech, a historic Islamic school located in the heart of Marrakech and the Bahia Palace. We walked 5.1 miles in total in the heat of Marrakech, so would not recommend if you have mobility issues.  The coach returned us at 12:30 approx - value 5/10.

Checkout - our hotel pick-up was 17:35  - we asked for a late checkout and this was granted at no cost.  

 There are tip boxes in in reception to tip the various departments.
 
We enjoyed our stay at TUI BLUE Medina Gardens and would recommend it as a destination for your stay.

Beautiful and Relaxing Stay,"This hotel is one of the best hotels I have stayed in. If you're looking for a relaxing stress free holiday this is the hotel for you.
Rooms- Very comfortable beds and all the essentials you need. Cleanliness is excellent.

Gardens/Pools- Perfect. There is something for everyone. Busy main pool but still relaxing. Private and relaxing garden spaces to sunbathe in and a lovely relax pool. The hotel was full capacity and there are no sunbed wars unless you specifically want a certain bed, however that is your choice and there are always plenty of beds available in the beautiful garden areas which I preferred as they had natural shade under the lovely garden trees. 

Restaurant- Could not have asked for more. The main buffet restaurant (the only one we use on our 4nts stay) was faultless. The food was varied and very tasty. Plenty of choice for everyone. What I appreciated the most though after staying in numerous AI hotels is that this one did not have the over busy canteen feel, it is an oasis of relaxation. I can not explain enough how relaxing meal times was at this hotel compared to other AI hotels I have stayed in.

Staff- Amazing!! All of them. I can not name just one, they were all as friendly and helpful as each other and this is the first time I have experienced this in a hotel. They are so helpful and always have a smile on their face despite how busy. They work long hours in high heat and I never heard anyone complain. They are a true credit to this hotel. 

Gardens- Beautiful. The resident cats I loved (as a cat lover) to fellow cat lovers that have stayed here mum cat is doing well and her kittens, saw the staff feed them and they truly do look after the animals there which I appreciated.

Entertainment- The usual AI entertainment which was pretty good. The Moroccan night was a highlight.

Spa- A friend and myself visited and the massage was amazing. The price is very reasonable and the staff were so friendly and accommodating. I would highly recommend a visit.

If you stay here you will not be disappointed. Proximity to Marrakesh is perfect. The staff are all amazing and friendly. Not once did I feel the need to tip all the time, it mode no difference to the experience I received and in turn I made sure that I tipped well in the very convenient tip box for all staff in the reception area. This made the whole tipping process so much more easier and relaxing and to be honest all hotels should adopt this practice, as I am sure people tip much better this was if they do not feel harassed to do so. Please if you stay here tip generously at the end of your stay using this method as all the staff here deserve praise.

I stayed here with friends but will definitely be back soon with my husband who will absolutely love this hotel.",TUI BLUE Medina Gardens,Tourist+Attraction,Marrakech
Exelent,A charming and serene spot hidden within the hustle of Marrakech. The garden is beautifully maintained with vibrant colors and traditional decor. A great place to relax and take in the atmosphere. Perfect for photos and a short break from the busy souks.,TUI BLUE Medina Gardens,Tourist+Attraction,Marrakech
The best holiday for Peace & Tranquility,"Very quick through airport & leaving on the bus within 30 mins, very impressed with this hotel as soon as we walked in, we were led to seats with mint tea offered before being given our room allocation.
The restaurant was left open for us to eat which was lovely after all the travelling 

On our first night we initially had problems with the air conditioning not working, it took 3 phone calls and 2 visits to reception and nothing was sorted. We spent our first full morning trying to sort it out & It took me eventually going to our tui rep who immediately jumped in and offered another room which we accepted, they were amazing both Abir & Zineb very patient with us. It wasn't fun having to repack and move everything but we were so grateful in having air conditioning the rest of the week.
The hotel is absolutely stunning, we loved the gardens and spent most of our time there as it was slightly cooler that the main pool but we used both pools for swimming, no problems getting a sunbed at any time of day. 

Wifi very good - usually get an esim but wasn't needed this time
We ate every day at the restaurant, food was nice and a good variety, our waiter yasine was very efficient and friendly, we really enjoyed getting to know him over the course of the week and nothing was too much trouble for him. 

We dont drink alcohol but soft drinks all from a bottle and quite lukewarm, a pump tap would've been much better for both staff and guests but we did get ice cold still & sparkling water from the machine. 

We did some of the classes with Laura, she is wonderful really put us at ease and was great with the classes. We had no plans to go to the medina square as we were honestly really anxious about it, she really encouraged us to go even just to walk around and gave us lots of tips and we ended up going, she needs a medal for that 😂
We also had a lovely massage, absolutely incredible experience.
Overall this place is all about peace and tranquility with still lots going on, I've never been to the same place twice but I will definitely be returning here and recommending to other friends.
Best holiday I've ever had ❤️ 

Some niggly bits 
The partition wall between the bedroom & shower needs more privacy, for those staying who are not couples it can be a bit awkward having to undress to get in the shower.
Needs more hooks in the room as there was absolutely nowhere to hang any towels or anything.
Mealtimes constantly having to ask for bowls and spoons as they are not on the table
Shower tray needs some antislip on the gloss white tray so slippery",TUI BLUE Medina Gardens,Tourist+Attraction,Marrakech
Some like it HOT! Moroccan magic...,"Probably best to start with what's great about this characterful place:
- general vibe. Chilled, no pressure to do anything. If you want/need a place to just 'splat' then you got it. Hearing the daily calls to prayer from within the hotel was fascinating and reminded you where you were -  in the heart of a bustling North African city which is right on your doorstep if you want to explore
- mostly extremely pleasant, friendly staff who clearly work very hard and put in the hours to look after both the customers and the hotel itself. The gardens are lovely with real points of interest and the pool is clean and well kept. 
- the food is great, and I like that if you want 'UK' food (which you really shouldn't whilst here) it's lunchtimes only for chips! 
What could be better...:
- Rooms are a bit tired. Hit with the smell of stale cigarette smoke upon entry. And bits just periodically fell off during our stay - the patio lock, the door lock, the shaving mirror landing in my hand. Our shower door didn't work properly and the handle was covered in limescale. The safe deciding it wasn't letting us in. Minor gripes but expected a bit better. Also, unless you're with your true love, there's not much in the way of privacy with the bathroom being quite exposed to the bedroom area. Towels could do with a refresh, as well, they were quite rough and threadbare. 
- The bar service overall was pretty good, if you're not in a hurry. But the inconsistency in what you asked for (unless it was wine or beer), was quite dramatic. Some times mindblowingly strong cocktails and others had us questioning if there was any alcohol in them. And the pool bar staff were almost mute in their interactions - at least with me. To be fair, I think I'd be a bit naffed off if all carbonated drinks had to be served from plastic or glass bottles and not on tap. Come on TUI, this is a busy hotel, you can't expect staff to serve drinks like they're at a kids' party! Same for the restaurant area. The poor servers have tiny little workstations - no wonder there were a few spectacular crash/tinkles.
Overall, however, it's a lovely hotel, with some fun - but not too full on - entertainment, and quiet spots for those that want it. Add on the Lionesses winning whilst we were there which turned the Fountain Bar into an impromptu jamboree venue and would I recommend this place to friends and family? Yes!",TUI BLUE Medina Gardens,Tourist+Attraction,Marrakech
