Marrakech,Hotel,La Maison Arabe,Authentic Moroccan experience,The staff at this hotel are so attentive. All your requests and needs are met immediately. The rooms are large and decorated in authentic traditional Moroccan style. At first getting to your room is like being in a maze with so many courtyards and corridors but you soon find your way. Very private and no outside noise except you can hear the birds singing. The breakfast and afternoon tea are very refreshing. Two restaurants on site if you arrive jet lagged you don’t have to go out. All in all a wonderful experience and I would stay there again. Highly recommend this hotel.,Tripadvisor

It’s a perfect course for all levels, then eating the final product in the beautiful dining room is a sublime experience.",Tripadvisor
Marrakech,Hotel,La Maison Arabe,Magical Marrakech,"We not only had a wonderful experience at your hotel but your city was amazing. The La Maison Arabe property is very lovely. The spa was under renovation but we had a beautiful experience nonetheless. Each room and nook were beautifully decorated all very traditional and welcoming. We loved wandering through on the way to the piano jazz bar. What an absolute treat to have such talented musicians every night !! The bartenders made exceptionally crafted drinks. We enjoyed many nights at the lounge. Also that cinnamon smell radiating when you walk in reception was yummy. The staff…
All the staff that we encounter were absolutely amazing. They went out of their way to make us feel welcomed and they were so very accommodating to our needs. They truly are the reason we would recommend the hotel and come back to stay. We truly feel they were exceptional. 
The cooking class was outstanding! 
The 3 hours flew by. We all agreed that the cooking experience was the best of all our activities that we scheduled for our entire stay. Walking distance from the markets and Bahia Palace as well as the Saadian Tombs",Tripadvisor
Marrakech,Hotel,La Maison Arabe,Magical stay in this historic hotel.,"Incredible stay at the hotel. The grounds of this historic hotel can’t be matched. The staff is so incredibly warm, kind, and knowledgeable. They made my stay one I will remember forever. I traveled alone and felt safe and looked after by the hotel team every day. I will always come back here when I am in Marrakech. Beautiful city with beautiful people.

Marrakech,Hotel,La Maison Arabe,Second visit to this wonderful hotel.,"La Maison Arabe is an excellent and peaceful hotel in a very good location for exploring the Medina and also further afield; we walked to the Jardin Majorelle and Gueliz in less than thirty minutes.
The hotel rooms and public spaces are beautifully decorated in traditional Moroccan style and everything is very clean and well maintained. 
The hotel's country club is a great facility just outside the city, great place to go in the afternoon heat to enjoy the pool and relax. 
The food is great, the breakfast buffet has a very wide choice and the restaurant in the evening has an excellent menu and very interesting wine list featuring mainly Moroccan wines, which we rate highly.  We also enjoyed the roof top bar for more casual dining. 
Although we find everything about this hotel to be excellent, the most impressive aspect of La Maison Arabe is definitely its staff. They could not be any more helpful or friendly, they are a real asset to the hotel.
This was our second visit to this wonderful hotel, and we will definitely return.",Tripadvisor
Marrakech,Hotel,La Maison Arabe,The absolute best!,"I can’t say enough about Maison Arabe. I have had the great fortune of traveling and it’s the most wonderful, magical place I’ve ever stayed. The staff is exemplary!!! The food is amazing. My only disappointment is the pool was closed and we learned having dinner there is highly recommended. I can’t say enough about the staff! I felt like a princess. In fact, I get choked up thinking about how kind everyone was. A special thanks to Hakim, Redwane, the bar tender and another gentleman who also worked at the front desk. Everyone was special!! I hope to return one day!",Tripadvisor
Marrakech,Hotel,La Maison Arabe,"Luxurious, authentic and historic.","We were very pleasantly surprised by La Maison Arabe, when booking we didn't study it much but the service was 5* from the moment we booked. The hotel refunded us for an extra day we accidentally booked which was very kind. They knew I'd recently been in a traffic accident in the UK so they organised a 4x4 car to pick us up from the airport for free. The team were highly professional and warm spirited throughout our stay. They helped us organise trips, taxis and offered daily advice. Our room was immaculate, opulent yet homely and felt luxurious. I've tried to recreate our stay at home by buying orange blossom essence, brass hooks and towel robes :)

The hotel has a jazz piano bar and lots of history too. I think Winston Churchill was a frequent visitor. 

As someone who cannot eat gluten or dairy I often find hotel breakfast difficult. However the food was great! I had almond milk in my coffee and plenty of options for food; omelette, fresh figs, fresh beetroot juice, savoury options, fruit, quinoa and more. 

At the time of visiting the pool was under construction so the hotel had an hourly shuttle which took us to their second private property which has a fabulous luxury outdoor pool set in hectors of gardens and in a beautiful setting. I would have liked to have known about this before arriving, but they certainly redeemed themselves. 

My only criticism was that one of the taxis they booked us during the week didn't have seatbelts, but perhaps they didn't know that when booking. And, that the fallback pool didn't serve alcohol like the hotel did. But the lunch we ordered was delicious. 

The hotel is very well located and we mostly walked everyday to our destinations. On arrival we booked a walking tour which was such a great idea as we saw so much of the local area and the guide over indexed on the arts which is our passion. 

I'd definitely return here again!",Tripadvisor
Marrakech,Hotel,La Maison Arabe,Unforgettable getaway to the Arab House,"In addition to being a mythical Palace, the welcome was perfect for all the staff with a welcome mocktail and every day a tea time/pastry served at 5pm in the patio and its fountain.

Marrakech,Hotel,Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,A Magical Stay for the Whole Family – Highly Recommended! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️,"We recently stayed at the Four Seasons Marrakech as a family of three (two adults and our three-year-old son), and it was a truly unforgettable experience. From the moment we arrived, we were greeted with warm smiles and exceptional service. The staff were incredibly attentive, polite, and genuinely welcoming.

The resort itself is stunning – lush gardens, serene walkways, beautiful architecture, and a peaceful atmosphere. Our son had an amazing time, especially at the family pool, where the staff were absolutely fantastic. A very special thanks to Mr. Ismail and the entire team at the family pool – they were kind, professional, and consistently went out of their way to make us feel comfortable and well cared for.

The overall experience was flawless, and we deeply appreciated how family-friendly and accommodating the hotel was. We made some amazing memories here, and we’re already looking forward to our next visit. If you’re traveling to Marrakech with children, this place is a must!",Tripadvisor
Marrakech,Hotel,Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,An enjoyable stay but somewhat mixed in terms of service.,"I spent a week in Marrakech, splitting my stay between a resort on the outskirts of town and a 3-night stay at Four Seasons to explore the city. After an exceptional experience at the first resort, the Four Seasons proved less consistent in service. That said, the hotel does have some great staff amongst the team - particular thanks to Fatima and Hisham. 

Unlike most hotels, at the Four Seasons Marrakech many staff fail to acknowledge guests with a greeting when passing in public spaces, which diminished from the feeling of welcome.

Further details on the stay… 

> Arrival:
On arrival, only one receptionist was present and already occupied, leading to a short delay. During this time, a welcoming young gent offered Moroccan tea. The formalities of checkin were paired with some unnecessary personal commentary from the receptionist - enquiring on whether I enjoyed solo travel (as she did not) and later remarking on my lack of a tan.

> Room:
I was initially assigned a Garden Patio room, but construction noise prompted a move. This was expertly handled by the front desk supervisor, who arranged an Upper Pavilion room. This room was light-filled, spacious and well-appointed, with generous outdoor seating and peaceful garden views. It is also detached from the main building and felt private. Housekeeping was good, with the notable exception of missing turndown service on the second evening. As for sleep quality, the bed was the usual Four Seasons high quality however the aircon not very effective (even on the lowest setting & after being checked). 

> Hotel & Grounds:
It’s a lovely resort, and the architecture features some nice Moroccan touches - most notably the grand water feature leading to the main building and the indoor décor. Despite its proximity to the city, the hotel grounds are expansive and very enjoyable to stroll. Aircon in the lobby and reception area was inadequate.  

During my stay the hotel was undergoing maintenance, which had not been disclosed at time of booking or on their website. This included the closure of the adults-only pool, leaving only the rather noisy family pool available. After raising this with management, they offered access to the pool in one of their villas. Service from Hisham, the waiter there, was outstanding - a contrast to the main pool, where on my first day staff were disengaged and guests needed to seek out staff / approach the bar themselves.

> Spa:
The massage was relaxing. It was however one of the smallest treatment rooms I’ve been in with some ill fitting curtain making the room brighter than it should be. 

> Dining:
Breakfast at Quattro was very enjoyable. There was a comprehensive buffet with local and international selections, eggs made to order, and a great selection of fruit juices. Staff were friendly and it was a lovely setting for outdoor dining.

Lunch at Azzera was underwhelming. The vegan cobb salad was beautifully presented, but would have benefited from a sauce. Despite an empty well staffed venue, service was inattentive - no one checked on the meal after it was served, water wasn’t replenished, and the table wasn’t cleared for some time after dining.

Early evening drinks at Inara on the first night were forgettable - neither the bartender nor waitress knew what a Daiquiri was. 

Zest Rooftop was a standout however - lovely views, good service, tasty cocktails, a DJ, and an enjoyable Asian-inspired menu.

Finally, a note on vegetarian options: beyond salads and pasta, these were limited across all main menus including room service menu. I also had to repeatedly remind staff of a nut allergy, which most premium hotels note at check-in or after the first interaction when dining.",Tripadvisor
Marrakech,Hotel,Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Superb service and experience. The service at fourseasons was awesome from the moment we arrived.,"Sheer excellence at fourseasons. Service was of the highest order, staff were genuine, friendly and helpful. We spent 2 weeks here and every day was warmly received from all staff members, no matter what their role. Great food options, beautiful breakfast everyday overlooking the waterfalls. Would recommend a Hamman and massage at the Spa and the hotel offer great trip options from trips into the Medina through to the Atlas mountains and YSL gardens. The staff really made this stay special, was a 10/10 stay for us. Special,call out to Addessamad, Ishmael, Mohammed from the pool area and Mohammed from Zest restaurant. Our first trip to both Marrakech and Morocco and we will be back, in the main thanks to fourseasons hotel and their staff.",Tripadvisor
Marrakech,Hotel,Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Beautiful resort with spacious lovely rooms………worst food and awful menus. It’s hard to believe that in a Four Seaaons.,"The arrival staff  and checkin staff were excellent and we were upgraded to a beautiful spacious room.
After being in Morocco for a week and traveling to different hotels and restaurants and eating amazing fresh Moroccan cuisine it’s hard to believe that this property offered an American style rubbish menu and food to match.
They can’t even make a nice salad.
Highly disappointing.
Avoid eating here.",Tripadvisor
Marrakech,Hotel,Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Just an airport hotel?,"Just very average, rooms are dated and not special. It seems the public areas of the hotel have been made to look special for visitors but when you actually go to your room is completely different.

I overheard another guest saying it’s so convenient being 10 minutes away from the airport. If you are looking for that this will tick the box. 

There was also construction work happening that we were not informed about during the booking or prior to arrival.   

Very disappointing",Tripadvisor
Marrakech,Hotel,Four Seasons Resort Marrakech,Outstanding,"The most beautiful hotel ever . The staff are incredible, kind and attentive . Food was divine and the whole place is immaculate.

Marrakech,Hotel,Riad Kheirredine,Five Star Experience!!,The Riad Kheirredine was just AMAZING!! The service from beginning to end was something I have never experienced even as a seasoned traveler. The staff treated us like family and serviced our every need and were very warm and inviting. The property gives you the Moroccan vibe and at the same time it has a modern feel. We are planning a trip back in the near future. I highly recommend this property. You won’t be disappointed!!,Tripadvisor
Marrakech,Hotel,Riad Kheirredine,The best Riad in Morocco - there aren't enough superlatives,"After spending one night in Marrakech and another in the Agafay Desert, we locked in for the main event and stayed @riadkheirredine for 4 days and 3 nights. I am prone to superlatives but of the 50+ countries and hundreds of hotels that I’ve stayed in, the people at Riad Kheirridine stand above them all. There's no sense in reading any other review because I'm telling you point blank - the answer is Riad Kheirredine.

We absolutely LOVED Marrakech - from shopping for artisan-crafted goods (not just fake stuff from China) in the Souk to the outstanding food, this is a city (and Riad) that i will recommend to everyone i know. It's enchantment from movies is all accurate; a true jewel of Africa.

All of this would have made it an incredible trip on its own but I fell madly in love with the team @riadkheirredine. Why am I so effusive in my praise? They made Morocco accessible and calm and easy in a place that could feel overwhelming and insurmountable. Are you still a little bit unsure about the trip? Go to Kheirredine. 

First, they have someone who always walks with you in the medina and have three meeting points so you always feel safe and comfortable without knowing more than “shukran” in Arabic. It’s especially helpful at night; never once did I feel unsafe because I had a friendly buddy to guide us everywhere. 

The Riad gives you a smartphone and you text when you need ANYTHING - they arrange ALL the taxis so you feel safe and get the right price. You know how nice it is to know that you’re not a mark? You save so much money that way it practically pays for the Riad stay. It takes all the stress and anxiety away. All you do is send a text and you get someone to escort you and give you guidance in perfect English or French and a get-to-know-you conversation that brings enrichment to the experience. I became friends with all of the guys who were our guides. Ayoub is such a great guy and the boys at night - Ismail and Noureddine - were so cool and made us feel safe.

Fadwa is the hostess and front of house who plans everything after learning what you are looking for in the experience. If I owned a Riad I would ask her to name her salary because she is the key for the Riad and for us the most important person in Morocco to make the trip exceptional. Her warmth and hospitality made it feel like we’ve known her for years. She is intelligent and socially adept at understanding what kind of experience you're looking to have.  She stands above all and truly was integral to the trip. Listen - if you want to go to Morocco - you need to know her. She is the best of the best. The entire front office bends over backwards to help. I loved Karim, too - he's the smiling, cool guy who helps the Riad run flawlessly.

Amazing right? But that’s still not all of it. The Marrakech trip was made by the kindness of the entire team. 

My personal highlight was being invited by one of the staff members (Ahmed - my first friend who bridged the cultural gap) on day ONE to break fast with the staff at Iftar after the sun set. It’s Ramadan so each evening the team gets together which shows the closeness and family atmosphere of the Riad. Ahmed was the blink to open my eyes to Morocco.

I love cultures and food so I was ecstatic to be welcomed in after such a short time. Think of that - the first day they welcomed me into an intimate gathering that is for them and their beliefs. It made me reflect on how guarded and almost standoffish western culture is in terms of bringing in people who are different than us. Energy spent on exclusion is wasted; energy spent of welcoming those who seek to understand creates lifelong memories and friendship.

The three Iftar experiences are moments that I will cherish; conversations that ranged from Morocco and culture to the USA to their families (King of Kindness Mohamed is kid #13 in his family - 6 brothers and 6 sisters who grew up in the Sahara desert) to the status of cats in Morocco (A cat Kingdom 🐈 👑). The “Uncle” of the group is a gentle and kind man named Mehdi. We talked about travel and movies and I’m so stoked when he’ll get to fulfill his dream trip to Italy in the Fall. When was the last time you were shown pictures in a hot air balloon from someone at a Courtyard Marriott? I am proud to say that I will know Mehdi forever. My dude Rabbi is an aspiring rapper and so cool that I could drop him into Toronto or LA and he'd thrive. You’ll hear his tracks on my IG stories. The coolest cat with the moustache is Saleh and he'll make you the best drinks. The unlimited complimentary fresh-squeezed orange juice was out of this world and Khalid and Aymane would be looking for me to give me more. 

I always say that culture is the sharing of stories. People make a place great and the Moroccans we met @riadkheirredine showed me their culture in the greatest ways. 

If you want to go - and you should, trust me - you'll have the best time at Kherrredine. Move it up your list and find Fadwa. It'll be the trip of a lifetime.",Tripadvisor
Marrakech,Hotel,Riad Kheirredine,A fantastic riad in Marrakech,"We're a family of four whom had a wonderful stay at the riad. From the point when we arrived until we left was packed with great moments, excellent food, superfriendly people and very nice rooms. The people made us feel as we were home. Only regret is that the riad was closed when we returned back to Marrakech. A stay far beyond expectations.",Tripadvisor
Marrakech,Hotel,Riad Kheirredine,Amazing stay at Riad Kheirredine,"Its hard to describe how beautiful this place is. My wife and I have travelled extensively and we both agree this is , overall, the nicest place we have stayed. We were upgraded to a beautiful suite with a large living room and a nice wrap around balcony overlooking one of the courtyards in the riad. Everything here is an 11 out of 10 - the service, the food and drink and the incredibly gracious staff. We also utilized the spa and did the traditional hammam experience with a massage.  The Riad is located within the medina and it is a short walk to all of the shops etc. We loved the location.
We really enjoyed relaxing on the rooftop of the Riad .  In the evening, we would have a drink at the rooftop bar and then eventually sit at one of the rooftop tables and enjoy a leisurely dinner. We also had a fantastic breakfast on the rooftop every morning.  Honestly, we did not want to leave. Thankyou for a wonderful experience. If we ever go back to Marrakech, we will defintely be staying at Riad Kheirredine.",Tripadvisor
Marrakech,Hotel,Riad Kheirredine,This is the best place you will ever stay!,"Best experience of our life! I'm telling you, this was the most wonderful stay we've had in all our travels around the world. 
They ordered our driver to pick us up. He was waiting upon arrival. Drove us to the location near riad where the staff was waiting to take all our luggage to the riad. While you're walking to get to the riad, you think OMG, is this going to be ok? Then you walk in to Riad Kheirredine and all your worries fade away! Drinks upon entering, the staff, especially Fadwa made you feel right at home. She showed us every aspect of the riad, all the stunning rooms, food menu, pools, spa facilities, etc. When I say, stunning, I mean stunning. Everyone greets you by name. Our first evening we had Moroccan menu on rooftop and our waiter treated us like royalty. The food was marvelous! Our room was stunning as well! Our bed was a Euro King, which if you know, you know! Loved it! We had a  twin bed for our teen daughter. So comfy. Dark room so you can sleep peacefully. Birds chirping in the morning. Food can be ordered if you want it to the room. 
The Riad also provides you with a cell phone so when you're out in the Medina or walking around and need anything you text them, they will respond and order you a Tuk Tuk or taxi to get you back to a meeting point and one of the staff will come pick you up!! 
We had 3 massages at the spa and it was the best massage I've had. My husband, daughter and I all agreed it was fantastic! They come to your room, hand you your robes, then you follow the ladies to the spa where you are pampered and rubbed. After, you can sit in the serene spa area where you drink tea, have some cookies and relax as long as you'd like. 
Laundry service is included in your stay which was great for us as we had been traveling for about a month in Spain before we arrived. Clothes were laundered and pressed very quickly and hung in room after our day out. 
The breakfast which was included with our stay was so fresh! Juice, fruits, eggs, bread, etc. 
In case you haven't noticed, we truly loved every single bit of our stay. It's a nice reprieve from the hustle and bustle of Marrakech city center and everyone felt like family. 
The owner of this riad knows how to do it right! She's Italian and was there during our stay and you can tell she loves what she's created and the people enjoy working there. Truly a magical experience.",Tripadvisor
Marrakech,Hotel,Riad Kheirredine,Fantasic. with a minor negative on AC.,"Just like the other reviewers said. The service is simply the BEST. The location is great. 15 mins walk from the Medina. Included breakfast was amazing. There is a reason this is ranked #1. So, the only negative, I would say was that A?C was not strong enough and needs to be updated. As it was July and we were at the top floor. it was getting very hot and wouldnt cool fast enough. Now this doesnt apply if you travel in non-summer. Other than that, I would go back there and stay there again. We were very happy with the hammam and Spa service. 
Thanks Elena and everyone else.",Tripadvisor
Marrakech,Hotel,Riad Kheirredine,A Hidden 5-Star Oasis in Marrakech,"What an absolute gem of a place to stay! I wasn’t sure what to expect at first, but from the moment we arrived, everything felt warm, welcoming, and effortlessly professional. An attendant from the riad kindly met us and guided us through the winding alleyways – already adding to the sense of mystery and adventure.

Then, as the door opened, we were completely taken aback – behind the unassuming entrance was the most stunning oasis, filled with beauty, charm, and smiling faces ready to greet us. A welcome drink on arrival set the tone – all class, without any pretence. I’ve stayed in many five-star hotels around the world, but this place truly holds its own.

The rooms were a dream – quiet and secluded, yet still just a short stroll from all the action, without a hint of the city noise. The food and hospitality were nothing short of exceptional, and the attention to detail – in the décor, the rooms, and the service – was outstanding.

We loved every moment. Having never stayed in a riad before, we didn’t know what to expect, but this experience surpassed every five-star hotel we’ve visited. If you’re heading to Marrakech, staying here is an absolute must!",Tripadvisor
Marrakech,Hotel,Riad Kheirredine,DA dream experience,"We stayed in this Riad with a couple of friends and immediately we were welcomed as a family, we arrived at nine in the morning after traveling at night and immediately although not included we were offered a wonderful breakfast, the staff is extremely present at all times of the day, ready to cuddle you and solve problems. Every time we went out on a hike, we were provided with a mobile phone where we could always be in touch with the hotel staff. Very clean room and typical and well-kept structure in the center of the Medina.

Marrakech,Hotel,Riad Kheirredine,A perfect oasis in bustling Marrakesh. I would give it 6 stars if I could.,My wife and I just got back from a 4 night stay. This riad exceeded our expectations! We also booked a room for our newlywed daughter and son-in-law. The riad decorated their room with rose petals on the bed. The hotel is gorgeous in the traditional Moroccan style. It is immaculately clean. All of the staff were superbly attentive. Everyone spoke English. House keeping attended to the rooms twice daily with turn down service in the evening.  The food was excellent. Being July it was very hot. The rooftop restaurant after sunset was the perfect place to have dinner and enjoy the sounds of the  Medina in a relaxing breeze. The included breakfast is amazing. We took it in our room and at the indoor restaurant. The 3 crystal clear pools were inviting. We mostly spent our afternoons in the pool near the bar. The bartenders brought us drinks to the pool and never let our glasses empty. I fell in love with Moroccan tea and room service brought it to our room upon request at no additional charge. The included laundry service spoiled us. The spa was luxurious and the prices were half that of a spa in the United States. We had a couples hammam and couples massage 3 days in a row. We took two excursions while staying. Our balloon ride had a meeting point and a staff member happily walked us to the spot at 4:50am. We wanted a guide to show us the Medina and souk. The riad arranged everything and charged the tour to our room. We were so sad to have to leave.,Tripadvisor
Marrakech,Hotel,La Mamounia Marrakech,Amazing Honeymoon Experience,"We went for our Honeymoon and this was the most amazing Resort. The staff, the service, the accommodations, everything was amazing.

Housekeeping and concierge also very attentive, we never waited more than 3 minutes for anything.

Marrakech,Hotel,Sol Oasis Marrakech,"Could have been better in terms of cleanliness in room , storage and food choices.","We have been to five star hotels but this one is not five star . This is my experience and I feel staff is trained in such a way that they know which nationality they should be giving preference to.
Drinks were not that good. The only drink was perfect was their coffee from indore bar.
Welcome drink cups were stained all the way around and horrible sugary water. Apparently they were serving fresh orange juice as welcome drink aswell but to some special guest. As far as food is concerned it was not upto standard beside pasta and pizza.
If you carry on tipping every day then one might get some special favours. Just to make our stay comfortable we have to do that.
I agree with other guest rooms are small and cloth storage is not enough for two people sharing hence we left our cloths in suitcases to say the least for comfort.
Guest relation was helpful and manager at breakfast time provided good service.",Tripadvisor
Marrakech,Hotel,Sol Oasis Marrakech,Fantastic hotel,"We’ve just returned back home from a week at the Sol Oasis and we loved every minute of it. The majority of the reviews for this hotel are amazing and they are spot on. I can’t believe some of the recent lower rated reviews considering the experience I had here.

The food was incredible in my opinion, there were a lot of Moroccan foods in the buffet at lunch and dinner and I was excited to try all the different types of tagines that I could. Fussy eaters may struggle a little bit but my advice would be to just try as much as possible. If that fails, you can always go up the pizza oven by the bar and get a pizza. That was a great option to have throughout the days, from about 2pm til 10pm I think.

As for the drinks, on the most part they were great. One negative was that the same cocktail with one barman could taste completely different when ordered from the next barman, but we never had any that tasted bad. The cocktail list itself was decent and the bar staff will make you something that isn’t on the menu if you ask. There were 3 options for beer, Estrella, San Miguel and a local beer - all included in the AI. They are all bottled as they do not have draught beer. Soufiane and Nouredine deserve shout outs on the bar team.

The staff at this hotel are amazing, everyone was so friendly. The entertainment team as a whole are fantastic and they all take time out to get to know you and it’s genuine. Big shout outs to Khalil, Mohamed and Robio in particular who spoke with us often.

We got a massage in the spa which was good and cheap compared to the UK.

The rooms are slightly on the small side but the interior is great and overall we were very happy with the room.

The hotel is about 35/40 mins from the airport and about 30/35 mins to the medina. The hotel clearly states this and anyone who books the hotel should know this before booking, I don’t understand why people book this hotel and then complain about the location. The hotel provides a shuttle bus at multiple times during the day and this needs to be booked via the app but is very convenient and great to have. This is provided at check in.

Important to mention a couple of minor feedback points:
Drinks service at lunch and dinner was poor mostly, it’s fine if you want a soft drink or a glass of wine as they are left out for you to take as you want, but to get a beer at dinner wasn’t easy and nobody came over to us to offer one except for on one occasion.
Some sort of drinks service around the pool would be a great addition, I’m more than happy to walk to the bar for a drink but every so often the queues would be quite big so having that option would have been good.

I could go on and on listing the positives of this hotel but in conscious of the length of this review! The bottom line is if we decide to return to Marrakech, there is absolutely no doubt that it would be to the Sol Oasis.",Tripadvisor

We arrived late on Saturday, but the reception staff welcomed us warmly and helped us with everything we needed. The next day, when we asked to change our room, they responded kindly and handled it with a smile.

The food was delicious, and the kitchen team did a great job. We really enjoyed trying new dishes.

The animation team was energetic and professional. They truly knew how to entertain guests and get everyone involved in the activities. Some of the team members who stood out were Jenna, Mo, Hamza, Mido, Zack, and Sam — they were all friendly, lively, and great at what they do.

Marrakech,Hotel,The Oberoi Marrakech,Excellent holiday,"One of the best hotels we have stayed at -beautiful setting , incredible design , very spacious . Not only that but the friendliness and efficiency of all  the staff  was incredibly good. Our room - Deluxe Villa with pool was one of the best we have stayed in - pool was excellent - big enough for swimming and a beautiful garden setting for relaxing. 

Grounds were beautifully kept and enjoyable for walking around- especially to see the rescue donkeys! Even managed a game of Petangue ! Spa was very spacious with a sizeable indoor pool and the treatments were excellent.

Reception were always freindly and helpful and the WhatsApp messaging system worked well. Concierge desk organised some trips for us which were most enjoyable.

We used all three restaurants and all were excellent .We lunched most days at Azure enjoying beautiful salads .Dinners at Rivayat were  excellent and we enjoyed the "" tasting "" menu with paired wine flights which were all well chosen .We loved the outdoor setting at Tamint - the views were mesmerising and the food was excellent but just the slightest criticism of the choices available- staying eight days , we had no menu changes although we were able to pre-order some dishes which were specially made. Thoroughly enjoyed the suggested Moroccan wines which were a very high standard.  Staff in all three restaurants were so friendly and efficient and clearly gave the impression that they wanted you to enjoy yourselves.

Marrakech,Hotel,The Oberoi Marrakech,Perfection at The Oberoi Marrakech.,"The breakfast buffet was diverse and delicious. The staff were not only helpful (they insisted to take my plate to my table for me while I continued to browse the selection) they informed us of and offered us local specialities including a local nut spread, tea, coffee and local breakfast breads.

We were celebrating my birthday and they upgraded us to a villa with a private pool decorated with rose petals, balloons and gifts. So many gifts!

The set menu at the indian restuarant was a culinary experience with lovely staff and beautiful (and tasty) food offerings.

Additionally we booked a hammam experience at the spa. Again, we were treated like royalty. No detail was left unattended. Thank you very much to the two ladies that attended to us - it was a unique and indulgent experience! And to all the staff - thank you for my generous birthday gift.

Every staff member we felt lucky to work with but a special mention for a few of them: Mamdouh Milad, Mahdi and Insaf were at the top of their game. Thank you so much for making our holiday to Marrakesh absolutely unforgettable!

Extra special mention to Zakaria... he took care of us for the majority of our time at the Oberoi. His humour and intelligence were a delight to accompany our meals and leisurely cocktail hours. Perhaps next time we can challenge you to that card game!

To everyone at the Oberoi - thank you so much for a delightful holiday with you.",Tripadvisor
Marrakech,Hotel,The Oberoi Marrakech,A relaxing stay with exceptionally warm service.,"I’ve been fortunate to have stayed at many premium hotels, and the Oberoi Marrakech truly stands out among the best for its genuine hospitality. 

Oberoi have created a beautiful, spacious & modern resort with lovely historic touches - the attention to detail in architecture of the main building a highlight. The grounds are sprawling with several enjoyable shaded pathways to explore. Aside from indoor and outdoor pools, there’s also a spa, a gym and a tennis court.

The service was excellent. From the warm welcome, the orientation of the hotel, and the countless staff who remembered my name after just one interaction. Managers were very hands on, always present and showed genuine warmth. Even the gardener discreetly moved aside when he noticed I was taking a photo of the grand canal - so thoughtful.

The Deluxe Villa with private pool was spacious, beautifully appointed and modern whilst retaining charming Moroccoan features. Housekeeping was excellent, but I did find one habit detracted a little from allowing me to feel more at home: each day, the villa was reset as though for new guests - informational signs placed back into prominent positions, rearranged toiletries, repositioned chairs.

Relaxing at the pool was very enjoyable, with loungers, day beds, and hammocks to choose from. One minor suggestion would be for the staff to check in more frequently - at best only two visits in six hours.

Breakfast offered both buffet and à la carte options. I’d highly recommend the shakshouka.  

Lunch at Azur was enjoyable, and I appreciated how allergy-friendly all the menus were throughout the property, as well as many common dietary requirements catered for by default. 

Dinner at Rivayat was exceptional. The tasting menu with wine pairings, the beautiful setting, and the fantastic DJ (Fri night) made for a memorable evening. 

Dinner at the other restaurant, Tamimt, was great - lighter fare but full of flavour. The vegetable tagine and pannacotta were tasty, and the live music (Sat night) and outdoor setting making for a very enjoyable evening.

My massage at the spa was very good. A minor suggestion would be for the kettle to be moved away from the relaxation area - its slow boil distracts from an otherwise serene space after the treatment. 

On a final note, I visited in July and the resort was very quiet. If you’re after a buzzier atmosphere, you might prefer a livelier season. The resort’s peaceful location is part of its charm and I found a 4-night stay the perfect duration, followed by a 3-night stay in the centre of Marrakech to take in the main sights and atmosphere of the city.",Tripadvisor

Marrakech,Hotel,Riad le Clos des Arts,A Hidden Oasis in the Heart of Marrakesh – A Perfect Yoga Retreat,"From the moment we arrived at this stunning riad, we were completely enchanted. Tucked away from the bustling medina, it felt like stepping into a peaceful sanctuary – the perfect setting for a yoga retreat. The tranquility, beauty, and warmth of the space instantly put us at ease.

The staff were beyond wonderful – warm, attentive, and always going the extra mile to make us feel comfortable and cared for. Every single person we encountered radiated kindness and hospitality. We felt truly looked after throughout our stay.

The food was absolutely incredible – fresh, nourishing, and full of flavor. Every meal felt like it was prepared with love, and it was the perfect complement to our wellness-focused retreat.

The riad itself is a dream – beautifully designed with authentic Moroccan charm, lush courtyards, and calming spaces that made it easy to unwind. The spa was a real highlight too – the treatments were world-class, and the hammam was the ultimate indulgence.

I met some beautiful souls during our stay and left feeling grounded, inspired, and already planning our return. If you’re looking for a peaceful, rejuvenating experience in Marrakesh with heartfelt hospitality, look no further. I loved every moment and will definitely be coming back.",Tripadvisor

The riad itself is stunning. Photos do not do it justice. The staff are *incredible*. Valeria, Denise, Issam, Sadik and Zakaria were out of this world. They’re super helpful with recommendations, getting your bearings and generally making you feel like one of the family.

The rooftop is an oasis of beauty. There’s the dipping pool to escape the heat, the loungers for the sun. Breakfast in the sun, and dinner by moonlight.

The food at the riad is, without any hyperbole, the best in Marrakech. Fresh home made meals that blow your mind. You simply must take advantage of the hamam on-site too. You won’t regret it. In short, we’ve never stayed anywhere like this before and we will definitely be back!",Tripadvisor

Located in the narrow, winding lanes of the Medina, it offers both seclusion from and access to everything you might want to see in Marrakech. The staff are happy to share their immense knowledge of the city and take time to meet and know their guests. They looked to ensure everything went well from the moment we flew in until we returned to the airport 

We dined at the hotel for three nights of our six nights, two of which felt like private dining. A different menu is published each day and the food was excellent.

The staff was incredibly helpful even before we arrived.

Once we got there, the service was truly outstanding. Everyone was kind, attentive, and flexible with our schedule. They made everything feel easy and seamless, which let us focus on enjoying our time together. We especially appreciated the care and attentiveness of Sadek, Zachariah, Yaseen, and Valeria—each of them made a real effort to ensure we were comfortable and well looked after throughout the stay.

A highlight of the trip was the surprise 80th birthday celebration we planned for our dad. The team went above and beyond to help us pull it off and make it special. Their support and thoughtfulness really stood out and meant a lot to our whole family.

The riad itself is beautiful—thoughtfully designed and well maintained. The location couldn’t be better: tucked just steps away from the Medina, but remarkably quiet and peaceful. After exploring the city each day, the rooftop pool was a perfect place to cool down and relax.

We’re very grateful to the entire team at Riad Clos des Arts. Their professionalism, hospitality, and attention to detail made this a trip we’ll always remember. We’d gladly return and highly recommend it to anyone visiting Marrakech.",Tripadvisor

Marrakech,Hotel,Riad le Clos des Arts,Just perfection!,"My wife and I stayed here for four nights to celebrate her 40th birthday - our first trip away without the kids since we became parents. What can I say - the Clos Des Arts is just perfect. From the moment we walked in we were enchanted by the luxurious smell the charming Moroccan decor, and overall relaxed vibe of the place. 

When we arrived we were greeted by  Valeria in the square, and she escorted us to the riad where over mint tea, she gave us such a warm welcome and provided us with such a comprehensive breakdown of what we needed to know, places to go to, places to avoid, which online resources to use (maps.me really is excellent), we felt truly looked after from the get-go. Everyone at the riad are just so genuine, friendly and hospitable - I got to know them all by their first names, it felt like we were being looked after by a family. 

The riad itself is situated very close to Jema El-Fenaa (about a 5 - 7 min walk) but in spite of that, it's so quiet at the Clos Des Arts, you'd never guess you were right in the middle of it all.  

What makes this place so special and stand out from the rest for me, is the personal touch. My wife is vegan, and I could not find anything in the form of a cake that didn't have eggs or butter to get her for her birthday. When I asked Valeria for suggestions, she arranged for the house chef to make a special plant-based cake for my wife, at no extra cost! Also, as a Muslim I wanted to go to the Koutobia mosque to do Friday prayer but was concerned that my lack of Arabic language skills would mean that I was refused entry. Issam kindly gave me his very own prayer mat to take with me, to make sure that I fit right in and would gain access without any trouble at all. 

Our time there flew by so quickly, we wished we'd booked a few more days. If we ever go back to Marrakech without the kids, we're definitely going to stay here again - it's an absolute gem. A huge thank you to Valeria, Abdel, Zakaria, Issam, and Yassine (and everyone else) for making our stay there so special.",Tripadvisor

From the careful induction meeting introducing us to the Riad and the Medina, to the delights of the in-house Hamman and the treat of eating breakfast and the occasional three course evening meal on the roof terrace, everything about our stay was exceptional.

Our room Bambou was authentically decorated, was spotlessly clean and the bed was incredibly comfortable. 

You can do as much or as little as you want here. A 15-min ride to the city or stay put, swim, relax, play boules or table tennis, have a beer by the pool or find a shady spot to read a book.

Marrakech,Hotel,Dar Ayniwen Hotel,A stylish oasis,"The hotel is a lovely green oasis in an area of sandy soil and palm trees north of Marrakesh, with most rooms in small buildings around the grounds.  We were upgraded to a suite (Tiwalin 1) which was very spacious and stylishly furnished.  Breakfast was served by the pool, and it was very good if a little unvarying - the yoghurt was delicious.  Whether the hotel is right for you or not depends on how you you want to spend your time.  It would be perfect for days in the sun by the pool, but we wanted to do sightseeing and this meant hiring taxis each day, which the hotel manager Aziz was very happy to arrange for us.  We had already stayed for 3 nights in a riad and wanted a change to some fresh air and green space.  We hadn't realised on booking that it was quite so far out of town, but it certainly gave us the relaxing outdoor space we were looking for.  We had a delicious dinner of fish/prawns on the second evening.  The problem was that the small number of diners made the atmosphere a bit awkward, and we didn't return on nights 3 and 4.  Overall a it was a luxurious and characterful hotel, with smiling and attentive staff, which we would be happy to recommend.",Tripadvisor

Marrakech,Hotel,Dar Ayniwen Hotel,Paradise in the Palmeraie,"I am a little reluctant to write this as I would love to keep this exquisite place to myself… But equally, Dar Ayniwen thoroughly deserves a glowing review. 

The property is located in the Palmeraie, a palm grove to the east of Marrakech, dotted with boutique hotels and gated private homes. Upon arrival, after a short drive from the airport, I was warmly welcomed by manager Aziz and, fresh mint tea in hand, I was taken on a tour of the hotel’s beautiful gardens. I say ‘hotel’ - in fact staying at Dar Ayniwen feels more like being an honoured guest in a private home (which it once was.) An upgrade to the beautiful Tiwaline 1 suite awaited me - and what a room! Adorned with antiques and featuring a separate living room, a domed marble bathroom with walk-in shower and a supremely comfortable bed, it was truly a home from home. On the ground floor, at the side of the main house, Tiwaline 1 opens to a shady riad style garden complete with tortoises and a very vocal Siamese cat!

My 2 night stay was intended as a quiet period of relaxation prior to the arrival of a relative in Marrakech for some more energetic leisure pursuits. And it couldn’t have been more perfect. A comfortable sun lounger was placed in the spot of my choosing on the expansive lawn near the (heated but still refreshing) pool for an afternoon of much needed sun. (26 degrees was an absolute joy after cold, grey late January England!) When I brought a soft drink from the fridge in my room, a glass was delivered with a little table. This is just one example of how the (superb) staff strike just the right balance - attentive but unobtrusive. And as a solo traveller and first time visitor to Morocco, I felt thoroughly looked after.

Meals are taken in a charming, cosy tent with an open fire. (There’s a terrace for balmier evenings). Breakfast is a tasty combination of fruit, pastries and Moroccan pancakes, brought to your table. Dinner - ordered in advance to ensure the freshest ingredients can be sourced on the day - was honestly the best food I have eaten in a hotel. The beef tagine was utterly sublime. On my first evening I was welcomed into the tent by owner Stéphane. Merci/shukran Stéphane for sharing your family home with your guests!

For a treat I had booked a spa treatment, but Amina, the hotel’s beautician, was unwell on the day I had booked, so the hotel arranged a transfer for me to and from a local hammam and spa about 10 minutes away, which I found via google. (I hope Amina is much better now.) 

After two blissful nights cocooned in this peaceful paradise, I left Dar Ayniwen feeling relaxed, refreshed and ready to take on whatever Marrakech had to offer! 

Thank you to Stéphane, Aziz, Ismael, Rashid and everyone who works so hard to make Dar Ayniwen such a welcoming place. They have truly nailed 5 star service in a boutique setting. I shall most certainly return!",Tripadvisor
Marrakech,Hotel,Dar Ayniwen Hotel,Heavenly,"A magnificent hotel, high-class welcome and service, all in a warm and friendly atmosphere. The owner is very attentive, the staff very discreet and attentive to the smallest details. The rooms are superb, very well equipped, with heating, important in this season! There is a lot of green space, magnificent aviaries and in addition private terraces in front of each accommodation, privatization and calm. All meals are delicious and plentiful.
A special thank you to Rachid and the chef.
Thank you very much to Aziz, for his availability, kindness and professionalism.

Marrakech,Hotel,Dar Ayniwen Hotel,Relaxing paradise,"This hotel is absolutely breathtaking. It exceeded our expectations for a peaceful getaway. The entire hotel is surrounded by gardens that you can explore, a beautiful pool and main house but to be honest for us the highlight was the staff and the chef!!! The food here was incredible!! If you’re looking for a more private getaway right outside of the city this is the place. There were also drivers available to be arranged at all times to go into the city or anywhere which was perfect for us. Aziz also made sure to give us all the best recommendations!!! Thank you again for such an incredible stay! ",Tripadvisor
Marrakech,Hotel,Riad Ben Tachfine,"convenient 1 km from the square , if you arrive late at night , do not be scared -","We arrived in Marrakech around midnight and I have to say that passing through the dirty, smoky alleys with strange people, the first approach was not the best. The riad is not exactly luxury and the area not really Dubai Marina:-) .BUT, never be fooled by the first impression. the next day with the sun and clean alleys looked better and with time we enjoyed the place than the people. The Moroccans, I must say, are very hospitable and not intrusive, I really liked them, and they are not the ones who come here to criminalize, it is good that you can not consume alcohol, otherwise there would be 200 accidents an hour seen how they run with mopeds through the alleys. That said, the riad has a good service, great breakfast the rooms are appreciable, not really new and perfect, but you always have to consider the cost and where we are. Would I go back? Yeah, maybe I'd try alternatives.",Tripadvisor
Marrakech,Hotel,Riad Ben Tachfine,A place to meet,The place allows you to fully grasp the spirit of Marrakech. Ahmed and Achraf are hosts of rare kindness and helpfulness. The structure is charming and quiet. Good quality breakfast. I suggest trying the Hammam experience,Tripadvisor
Marrakech,Hotel,Riad Ben Tachfine,An oasis of calm away from the bustling streets of Marrakech's Medina,"From Ahamed first meeting our Taxi on the street, to his welcoming Mint Tea, to his farewell, we felt well looked after by him and the team at Riad Ben Tachfine.
Easy to get to by taxi or bus followed by a short walk the Riad is set within a warren of alleys just off a bustling market street in the Medina.
It maybe cliché however it was truly an oasis of calm away from the bustling streets. Set on 3 levels it comprises 6 rooms and all appeared to be decorated in the local fashion with local furniture. Ours was spacious enough and there were plenty of other areas, within the riad, that could be utilised to sit and read or chat. The one we utilised the most was the roof terrace and ‘crows nest’ above.
The breakfast was predominately bread based, in a variety of forms along with an omelette and juice, which we devoured each morning. An evening menu was available however would need to be ordered in advance.
We decided to book the ‘in house’ Hammam and again were not disappointed with the experience
The staff were available 24 / 7 and we were always met with a smile no matter the time, or the request. Nothing was too much trouble, from the advice offered to the service received and we felt well looked after during our stay.
We would highly recommend Riad Ben Tachfine. A great location offering a quiet and relaxing place to stay after experiencing the hectic streets of Marrakech, with a welcoming and informative host!",Tripadvisor
Marrakech,Hotel,Riad Ben Tachfine,A lovely stay and great location,"A great location. Walls are very thin so you hear everything and especially when people sit up in the riad or it’s windy and the roof covering is being blown over. If you’re a light sleeper you could find this hard. The host was wonderful and very caring and gave us great advice and tips and took time to go through everything with us. Room was clean, though the hairdryer provided blew the electricity and we didn’t get it back for a while! Plenty of hot water and the breakfast is a good start to the day, but a bit of fruit would be nice with it. It’s a very useful stay when you want to be close to everything and we felt very safe walking around the area at any time of day or night.",Tripadvisor
Marrakech,Hotel,Riad Ben Tachfine,Enchanted parenthesis,"We spent a weekend with friends.
It was an enchanted parenthesis. We were made so welcome. Everything was perfect. Massages, meals, breakfast, decoration...

Marrakech,Hotel,Riad Ben Tachfine,A Hidden Gem,"The Riad is beautiful and well
appointed. Our room was clean and comfortable and it was lovely to take breakfast each morning on the open air terrace. We also enjoyed a delicious traditional meal on our first night. The staff - Muhammad, Mehmet and Asharaf and the rest of the team were exceptional and simply couldn't do enough for us - providing safety advice and tourist guidance as well as organising transfer to and from the airport. They are a great example of the graciousness and welcoming nature of the Moroccan people.

The Riad is deep in the alleyways
behind the souks and it can be daunting coming back at night in the dark. But the staff are in hand to provide advice and conducted us from our transfer taxi in our first night. We personally did not experience any problems on our way to and from the Riad at any time.",Tripadvisor
Marrakech,Hotel,Riad Ben Tachfine,Oasis In The “Desert” Of Marrakech,"Riad located in the food souk area in the ""upper part"" of the medina (15 minutes from Jemaa El Fna square) in a strategic position to visit Marrakech but at the same time far from the chaos and noise of the city;
The staff is superb, Ashraf's welcome and his availability in advising us where to go and giving us all the necessary recommendations every time we ventured to Marrakech was like that of a ""family man"" and made us feel right from the start. first minute as if we were at home within a family.
The riad is clean and well organised, the rooms are welcoming and have everything you need to have a pleasant stay; The kitchen offers typical Moroccan dishes and I must say after trying it a couple of evenings that it proved to be very good with the quality of the fresh and excellent quality raw materials.
Hygiene and cleanliness are higher than Moroccan standards.
Excellent value for money.
Thanks to Ashraf and the other collaborators for ""hosting"" us and making our trip to Morocco an even more beautiful experience.",Tripadvisor
Marrakech,Hotel,Riad Ben Tachfine,Horrible/terrible location but the riad itself is 10/10,"Okay so imma break into 2 the riad is 10/10 lovely ppl that work there very accommodating, excellent customer service. The riad itself is nice but it’s old so my shower and sink kept clogging. Stunning rooms and amazing breakfast however the location is terrible it’s behind the market and it’s an alleyway so at nighttime if you are just female travellers it’s very scary and the men kept starting and cat calling us at times. I didn’t feel comfortable at this location. We stayed in some nights because we didn’t want to walk through the alleyways at 2am 3am or 4am in the morning. The only way to get to this riad is through the alleyways the taxi can only drop you on the main road than you have walk 3-5 minutes down the market and alleyways to get to the riad, not to mention market smells so bad, they sell anything from fish/meat/clothes so you end up taking all that back to the riad. I didn’t feel like I was on holiday so we moved places after 2 nights. The riad itself is good vibes I loved it there but I don’t want to feel like a prisoner on holiday due to the location so we dipped. Didn’t get refund or even 30% back even though we stayed 2 night out of 7 nights. I was not happy with that at all.",Tripadvisor
Marrakech,Hotel,Riad Ben Tachfine,Not recommended!,"Not recommended!
We booked because the comments were good. I cannot understand it. We arrived in the night at 22.00.
Tha taxi driver asked them to come some meters to pick us up, but they didn t do it. No light on the street, we found finally the riad, the location is in a very poor primitive area, very dirty, lot a sick cats (with crying small baby s), not a pleasant experience to walk to the place. At night it’s very unsafe with beggars on the street. 
Inside, not clean (as my husband want to take a shower, the drainage was not working, a lot of hair floated on the water).
At breakfast on the day, were 2 tables, one was sitting the ownerfamily and at the second one a gast. The another gast was standig up to give us the table. My chair was broken, as the owner saw it, he gived me his chair, and told me, that he makes allways good things 😂.
So.., ( even if we already paid  for the 6 nights) we took the luggages and changed the riad. 
So, this was our experience...",Tripadvisor

Marrakech,Hotel,Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,Amazing Amazing experience!,"This was my second visit to the Be Live Collection Adults Only Resort, and it somehow managed to surpass my already high expectations from the first time. I had an incredible trip with my friends, and much of that was thanks to the exceptional staff who made our stay truly memorable.

A special thank you goes to Manager Mouhia and Kaoutar from Public Relations. Their warm, helpful approach made a real difference. Kaoutar, in particular, went above and beyond—when we had trouble reaching our external transfer company, she took it upon herself to track them down and ensure everything was sorted. Her dedication and professionalism were outstanding.

The indoor bar staff were also fantastic, especially the evening shift manager, who made every evening feel special. I’d also like to give a heartfelt shoutout to Momo from the pool team, who consistently went the extra mile to make our swimming experience enjoyable and relaxing.

Overall, the service at Be Live was exceptional across the board. I’ve stayed at other five-star resorts in places like Dubai, Turkey, and Qatar, but none have matched the level of care and hospitality I experienced here. We’re already planning our next visit!",Tripadvisor

Marrakech,Hotel,Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,A memorable holiday,"This hotel was spotlessly clean and the staff were very friendly and went out of their way to help you. We stopped in the swim up room which was a godsend in the 40+ degree temperatures. We had an iron and board, tv with a couple of English channels on, tea and coffee making facilities, bathrobes and slippers, free safe and a fridge which was stocked daily with little milk cups and a 2lt bottle of water daily. The wifi was excellent (they were having issues with WiFi externally) and the air con was great. We loved the large shower too. We had little ammeties in the bathroom. A couple of minor letdown were the bees around the snackbar and the lack of speed getting served  and the food was a little limited also. Having said that it was tasty 😋 but if your a picky eater you will struggle with the choice. Thank you for a wonderful holiday to all the staff there 😀 ps we named the little kitten Tiger 😀",Tripadvisor
Marrakech,Hotel,Be Live Collection Marrakech Adults Only,4 star,"Arrived and greeted with Moroccan tea . Porter took our bags . We had a swim up room very spacious and clean beds very comfy . Son had a sole room and it was fabulous for him . Mini fridge in room which was stocked up each day with one large bottle of water . Iron and ironing board in swim up room which. Safe which was free to use . Our air conditioning wasn’t great whereas as sons was really good . We had a bath and shower but could only use the bath water if we filled it up with the shower head . TV didn’t have many English channels apart from 2 . 2 pools one quiet with swim up bar , this pool is lovely but does need a little tlc . The guests spoil it sometime as they leave empty glasses all round the pool side and this attracts the bees which are everywhere as it is . The louder pool was actually cleaner looking but I do not put this down to staff but to the guests returning the glasses . Bees are a problem around the snack bar area especially and my husband was stung . I don’t know if there were epi pens if he had a reaction but I’m glad we didn’t need to find out . Restaurant food is plentiful and so much choice I really don’t understand people saying there isn’t choice . Staff all pleasant especially zizu in lobby bar and the 2 ladies on the snack bar . We had new bath towels everyday and new dressing gowns too . The pool staff are attentive and if they see you struggling with the umbrellas they help straight away . The entertainment team work hard but we don’t get involved as our holidays are for relaxing we do enough at home ! One thing is that you can only have 2 drinks at a time so you have to make journeys together if you want to get drinks for all family and there was always a queue . This was my big gripe as I saw some staff giving the holiday makers 4 at a time then refusing the next person . This happened on our last day but one when one guest asked for 4 drinks and as refused then sad they had been there 12 days already and they had never refused before she got her 4 drinks but I only had 2 . This is where it needs to be consistent and fair to all . The gardens are kept immaculate and the garden team work extremely hard and probably don’t get the credit they deserve . Evening entertainment was ok nothing special but sitting in the lovely lobby bar was very nice . There is a resident hotel cat and another 2 cats on hotel grounds one being a small kitten . I grew very attached to the kitten and I really hope that the hotel staff look after them . I did feed them every day . I would definitely go back . What i would change is have more sport on in sports bar, get more staff to help on the snack bar, try to reduce the amount of bees, allow the guests to have more than 2 drinks per visit to bar or bigger glasses . Introduce sparkling wine, more up to date entertainment on evening and rota every 2 weeks and a better toaster in the main restaurant. Big big shout out to the pasta station the food was incredible. All in all we had a fab 2 weeks holiday . Thank you",Tripadvisor

If you're looking for an all-inclusive right in the middle of a city, this is the place to go.

And if you want the best cocktails, make sure to visit Hamza and Abderahmane. Wow, such great guys and their cocktails are truly the best in the resort!

Thank you to everyone at TUI Medina Gardens for an unforgettable week.",Tripadvisor
Marrakech,Hotel,TUI BLUE Medina Gardens,Shocking decline in the space of 12 months,"We came back to Medina gardens for the second year in a row, having had such an amazing time last year. The 2 experiences couldn’t have been further apart. 

The air conditioning in the room was all but useless, even after having it on all night the temperate was still 21-22 degrees, with 40 degree plus heat outside it was extremely uncomfortable and difficult to sleep. We spoke to reception, someone came to clean the filter, which was absolutely filthy, but it made no difference. 

We purchased day beds so we could have some shade. On the Sunday, the beds by the main pool were all booked so we booked a bed by the relax pool. When we got to the bed, not only was it completely broken but there were no cushions on it. The bed was broken in the middle so both sides tilted towards the middle, the back section was completely broken off so we had nothing to lean up against. When we spoke to the lifeguard and asked for some cushions, he told us they were in the laundry. 

Upon check out we told the receptionist we didn’t use the bed on Sunday and asked them to remove it. I then had to wait over 30 mins on our last day for the manager to seek out the lifeguard and ask him. She then came back and told me they could not remove it from my charge as we didn’t let them know on the day and that it had already been charged to my room. We had booked a bed for the final day, so I asked if that could be refunded, the manager agreed, I paid the bill. 

Twenty minutes later the same manager came out to the pool to our bed and told me we had to pay for the bed! I refused. 

Service in the main restaurant was slow and poor, as was the food. 

We paid for a jacuzzi for our balcony; hardly any of the jets worked, the plastic surround was tatty and dirty, we only used it once. 

The WiFi was shocking. At least 50% of our stay we had none. It kept going in and out which was frustrating when you’re trying to listen to music or an audiobook by the pool. 

The resort wreaks of cost cutting and is no longer a premium facility. 

The only positive was the service of the guys making cocktails in ‘the bar’ they were brilliant, so friendly and excellent service. 

Needless to say we will not be returning next year.",Tripadvisor
Marrakech,Hotel,TUI BLUE Medina Gardens,"Beautiful, clean, friendly hotel.",Third time here but first time during Summer as usually come for New Year's Eve. Staff are friendly and helpful. They really do want you to enjoy your time. Food is excellent with great selection and very fresh. I did email hotel 3 times over a 4 month period before arriving in order to request room upgrade but never had response. Our room experience has got worse each time we come here.  Another thing to note is we asked for late check out and paid for this but was only given one option till 6pm. When looking on app we saw we could have checked out 2 hours earlier (which fitted with our flight) and it would have been cheaper. We did tell reception and they apologised. Entertainment staff seem to be enjoying themselves but could have done more to involve people during Entertainment nights. We feel this was much better at new year.  There is unfortunately the same age old issue of the reserving sunbeds at crack of dawn which is a pain and have seen this done so much better at other hotels with app reservations etc. The one morning that the sunbed policy was followed through was much better to avoid the sunbed hoggers who leave the towel and disappear back to bed etc.  Overall this is a beautiful hotel with very hard working friendly staff and we will most likely return again in the future.,Tripadvisor
Marrakech,Hotel,TUI BLUE Medina Gardens,An amazing two weeks away.,"Just back from our fourth stay here and it just gets better each year. 
Hotel is in a perfect position for exploring the souks and riads and a very short taxi ride to some of Marrakech’s best spots such as plus61 restaurant or Al Fassia Aguedal. 

We knew that there had been a change of manager this year and with that some staff changes, so wondered if it would have the same family ran feeling, but there were no issues at all. In fact the whole team were incredible. 
From Chef Said and his hard working squad delivering amazing quality hotel food (wait til you see the desserts!) to Aazzedine and Fatima 🥰 looking after us superbly. They have all been here years now and are an example to all in terms of service, politeness and friendliness. 
I swam every morning and called in to the restaurant for a coffee before going back to the room and the daily greeting from Abdullah is worth coming back here alone. Top top guy. 
Moroccan hospitality takes some beating, and this goes for outside of the hotel environment too, but if this hotel lacks in any 5star refinery then it’s made up for in spades by the people. 
From the warm welcome by Abir, Chawki and the management team after a late arrival, to the great service by the pool bar squad including Abdulwahid and Reda, topped off by the best bar staff in the city in Ahmed, Mohamed and Omar. 
There have been changes to the nightly entertainment, not something we’re huge on, but definitely better, and overall lots of little improvements around the whole hotel which are noticeable. There are even a peacock and hen wandering the superbly kept gardens now, which is a strange sight at first but really adds to the character of the place. 
Padel courts, a heated quiet pool for laps and a great gym keeps you in cake credit (you’ll need it), but if you just want to come away to switch off, enjoy some glorious uninterrupted sunshine with only a 15 minute airport transfer then this is the spot. ( RAK airport was great this year too, so it looks like they have addressed the queuing complaints)
There are so many amazing places to visit in the city and using Medina Gardens as a base is perfect. 
Trips to the secret garden, El Fenn, Kabana, Nobu are all within walking distance and Majorelle area with shops and museums is a 5 minute taxi trip.  Just beware of using InDrive as an uber alternative. Some of the drivers are lunatics! Better to pay the local taxis a bit more for a safer, more enjoyable trip. 
Not sure there’s much more to add and sorry if I’ve missed anyone out but I’m really struggling to think of anything negative to say. 
I miss lazing in the pool with the city sounds and the call to prayer floating over the garden walls. 
My wife and I will definitely be returning a fifth time.",Tripadvisor
Marrakech,Hotel,TUI BLUE Medina Gardens,Another Excellent Stay,"This hotel is serene relaxing and stress free with immaculate grounds comfortable and clean rooms and beautiful sunshine. The hotel is in a great location to explore Marrakech.
My husband and I have recently returned from our third visit to Medina Gardens and it continues to amaze me how in the middle of a city the beautiful gardens and the hotel are so peaceful and relaxing. Both pools are of a temperature that you can get straight in and swim and are of a size that they do not get overcrowded.
The restaurant serves a variety of different foods and they are not the same every night as there are different themes.  The head chef Said serves up delectable delights every night and would give Gordon Ramsey a run for his money.
All the staff are amazing and cannot do enough for you to make your stay memorable.  The pool bar staff led by Mustafa and assisted by cheeky boy Reda, Bada and Omar are contantly walking around the hotel grounds with drinks for the guests and they also remember your favourite tipple.  The restaurant servers Fatima and Armin are quick to fill your drinks glass and clear your table and are friendly polite and professional and nothing is too much trouble for them. Abdula the restaurant cleaner is constantly on the go keeping the restaurant clean and hygeinic.  The restaurant manager Chawki who is new to the hotel and had only joined the staff 2 days before we arrived goes above and beyond with his excellent hospitality. The reception I only visited to change currency and the staff member Moad was extreamly helpful and engaging.
The Tui rep Zenib is very knowledly if you have any questions about places to visit and she does not just sell trips if they are not  suitable and she is always on site at the time her notice states.  And last but not least the owner of the hotel Hassan who also comes on site most days and speaks to the quests to make sure eveything is going well.  The hotel has 24 hour security and the head guard Hassan keeps everyone safe.
I have travelled to many countries and only once in Thailand returned to the same hotel, but for a short flight, a beautiful hotel and grounds, relaxation, excellent food, amazing staff this for me is a hotel I can visit time and time again. We will be back for a forth visit",Tripadvisor
Marrakech,Hotel,TUI BLUE Medina Gardens,Good Stay At TUI BLUE Medina Gardens,"My wife & I have just returned from a two week stay at TUI BLUE Medina Gardens. Flying time was three hours five minutes from Bristol and Transfer time to the hotel was twenty minutes or so. We arrived at 21:30 but the restaurant remained open for our evening meal. During check-in you are fitted with your AI wristband.
 
We booked a jacuzzi room and were shown to room 2004.  The bed was large and comfortable - air conditioning worked well and was not noisy. Sleep quality was good although we heard loud music 01:20 one morning but didn't know the source.  Room servicing by the household staff was excellent!    I requested extra coat hangers via the Tui blue app - you can make maintenance and housekeeping requests via the app.
 
Wi-Fi - this was free and good within the hotel buildings but was patchy in the garden area.

Money exchange - change your GB pounds to Dirams in reception - we got and exchange rate of 11.8 to the pound. Don't take Dirams home - it's a closed currency. There is a charity box at the airport .

Pools - we used the quiet pool or the surrounding garden area during our our stay as the main pool was loud and busy.  Reserving of sunbeds is supposed to be against the rules but everyone did it.   Depth was 1.5M all areas .Get pool towels from the towel hut with your blue card.  Towels can be well used but are okay.

There is no drinks service at the quiet pool - you need to walk to the main pool bar for drinks or coffee. Nearest toilets were behind the Culinarium restaurant.

Food - we booked one evening meal at the Culinarium via the Tui Blue App - It wouldn't let us book again during our second week as it says one booking only via the app. We found the Culinarium okay but didn't worry about visiting again as we thought the main restaurant was much better for variety. We didn't use the Culinarium lunchtime for the same reason.

The Restaurant is the main place we ate all our meals - Breakfast was very good for choice with live cooking stations for eggs / omelettes etc. Staff were quick to serve Tea or coffee and clearing the used plates . Juices and various fruits available.

Evening meals at The Restaurant are themed - International , Moroccan,  Indian and seafood to name a few. No dress code is in operation here. Choices again are wide and varied. Fish was always available usually at the live cooking stations- The tagines were always worth a look as they contained meats , fish or vegetables cooked with preserved lemons.   Staff serving wines and water were prompt to ask you what you wanted to drink - All the wines including red, rose ,white and Prosecco were very drinkable.  Bottled or draught beer was good too. There was live music, violin and Moroccan, here some evenings too which was nice to listen to as you ate your meal.

Bar - the main bar and the Piano bar are nice and air conditioned, ( lovely when outside it was 40 degrees) although the piano person only appeared a couple of times a week we really enjoyed listening to him .  Service was good here as were the gin & tonics. AI Cocktails are available - the Pina coladas were very nice.

Entertainment - some nights a quiz or musical bingo was available at 21:00 before the main show at 21:45 in the fountain bar. These acts were mostly good. Bar service was ok. Shows include Moroccan show, live music or live act with belly dancers with fire!

Tours - we booked the 09:30 half day historical tour costing approx £30 each - this included a guide and coach - we visited the mosque you see and hear from the hotel (not inside) - we were then taken to the rear of our hotel (dropped behind the wall at the back of the Padel court to continue on foot)  We then walked through the arch across the road to enter the souks (no stopping to look at the stalls)  to visit  Medersa Ben Youssef Marrakech, a historic Islamic school located in the heart of Marrakech and the Bahia Palace. We walked 5.1 miles in total in the heat of Marrakech, so would not recommend if you have mobility issues.  The coach returned us at 12:30 approx - value 5/10.

Checkout - our hotel pick-up was 17:35  - we asked for a late checkout and this was granted at no cost.  

 There are tip boxes in in reception to tip the various departments.
 
We enjoyed our stay at TUI BLUE Medina Gardens and would recommend it as a destination for your stay.

I hope you find my review helpful!",Tripadvisor
Marrakech,Hotel,TUI BLUE Medina Gardens,Beautiful and Relaxing Stay,"This hotel is one of the best hotels I have stayed in. If you're looking for a relaxing stress free holiday this is the hotel for you.
Rooms- Very comfortable beds and all the essentials you need. Cleanliness is excellent.

Gardens/Pools- Perfect. There is something for everyone. Busy main pool but still relaxing. Private and relaxing garden spaces to sunbathe in and a lovely relax pool. The hotel was full capacity and there are no sunbed wars unless you specifically want a certain bed, however that is your choice and there are always plenty of beds available in the beautiful garden areas which I preferred as they had natural shade under the lovely garden trees. 

Restaurant- Could not have asked for more. The main buffet restaurant (the only one we use on our 4nts stay) was faultless. The food was varied and very tasty. Plenty of choice for everyone. What I appreciated the most though after staying in numerous AI hotels is that this one did not have the over busy canteen feel, it is an oasis of relaxation. I can not explain enough how relaxing meal times was at this hotel compared to other AI hotels I have stayed in.

Staff- Amazing!! All of them. I can not name just one, they were all as friendly and helpful as each other and this is the first time I have experienced this in a hotel. They are so helpful and always have a smile on their face despite how busy. They work long hours in high heat and I never heard anyone complain. They are a true credit to this hotel. 

Gardens- Beautiful. The resident cats I loved (as a cat lover) to fellow cat lovers that have stayed here mum cat is doing well and her kittens, saw the staff feed them and they truly do look after the animals there which I appreciated.

Entertainment- The usual AI entertainment which was pretty good. The Moroccan night was a highlight.

Spa- A friend and myself visited and the massage was amazing. The price is very reasonable and the staff were so friendly and accommodating. I would highly recommend a visit.

If you stay here you will not be disappointed. Proximity to Marrakesh is perfect. The staff are all amazing and friendly. Not once did I feel the need to tip all the time, it mode no difference to the experience I received and in turn I made sure that I tipped well in the very convenient tip box for all staff in the reception area. This made the whole tipping process so much more easier and relaxing and to be honest all hotels should adopt this practice, as I am sure people tip much better this was if they do not feel harassed to do so. Please if you stay here tip generously at the end of your stay using this method as all the staff here deserve praise.

I stayed here with friends but will definitely be back soon with my husband who will absolutely love this hotel.",Tripadvisor
Marrakech,Hotel,TUI BLUE Medina Gardens,Exelent,A charming and serene spot hidden within the hustle of Marrakech. The garden is beautifully maintained with vibrant colors and traditional decor.

Marrakech,Hotel,TUI BLUE Medina Gardens,The best holiday for Peace & Tranquility,"Very quick through airport & leaving on the bus within 30 mins, very impressed with this hotel as soon as we walked in, we were led to seats with mint tea offered before being given our room allocation.
The restaurant was left open for us to eat which was lovely after all the travelling 

On our first night we initially had problems with the air conditioning not working, it took 3 phone calls and 2 visits to reception and nothing was sorted. We spent our first full morning trying to sort it out & It took me eventually going to our tui rep who immediately jumped in and offered another room which we accepted, they were amazing both Abir & Zineb very patient with us. It wasn't fun having to repack and move everything but we were so grateful in having air conditioning the rest of the week.
The hotel is absolutely stunning, we loved the gardens and spent most of our time there as it was slightly cooler that the main pool but we used both pools for swimming, no problems getting a sunbed at any time of day. 

Wifi very good - usually get an esim but wasn't needed this time
We ate every day at the restaurant, food was nice and a good variety, our waiter yasine was very efficient and friendly, we really enjoyed getting to know him over the course of the week and nothing was too much trouble for him. 

We dont drink alcohol but soft drinks all from a bottle and quite lukewarm, a pump tap would've been much better for both staff and guests but we did get ice cold still & sparkling water from the machine. 

We did some of the classes with Laura, she is wonderful really put us at ease and was great with the classes. We had no plans to go to the medina square as we were honestly really anxious about it, she really encouraged us to go even just to walk around and gave us lots of tips and we ended up going, she needs a medal for that 😂
We also had a lovely massage, absolutely incredible experience.
Overall this place is all about peace and tranquility with still lots going on, I've never been to the same place twice but I will definitely be returning here and recommending to other friends.
Best holiday I've ever had ❤️ 

Some niggly bits 
The partition wall between the bedroom & shower needs more privacy, for those staying who are not couples it can be a bit awkward having to undress to get in the shower.
Needs more hooks in the room as there was absolutely nowhere to hang any towels or anything.
Mealtimes constantly having to ask for bowls and spoons as they are not on the table
Shower tray needs some antislip on the gloss white tray so slippery",Tripadvisor
Marrakech,Hotel,TUI BLUE Medina Gardens,Some like it HOT! Moroccan magic...,"Probably best to start with what's great about this characterful place:
- general vibe. Chilled, no pressure to do anything. If you want/need a place to just 'splat' then you got it. Hearing the daily calls to prayer from within the hotel was fascinating and reminded you where you were -  in the heart of a bustling North African city which is right on your doorstep if you want to explore
- mostly extremely pleasant, friendly staff who clearly work very hard and put in the hours to look after both the customers and the hotel itself. The gardens are lovely with real points of interest and the pool is clean and well kept. 
- the food is great, and I like that if you want 'UK' food (which you really shouldn't whilst here) it's lunchtimes only for chips! 
What could be better...:
- Rooms are a bit tired. Hit with the smell of stale cigarette smoke upon entry. And bits just periodically fell off during our stay - the patio lock, the door lock, the shaving mirror landing in my hand. Our shower door didn't work properly and the handle was covered in limescale. The safe deciding it wasn't letting us in. Minor gripes but expected a bit better. Also, unless you're with your true love, there's not much in the way of privacy with the bathroom being quite exposed to the bedroom area. Towels could do with a refresh, as well, they were quite rough and threadbare. 
- The bar service overall was pretty good, if you're not in a hurry. But the inconsistency in what you asked for (unless it was wine or beer), was quite dramatic. Some times mindblowingly strong cocktails and others had us questioning if there was any alcohol in them. And the pool bar staff were almost mute in their interactions - at least with me. To be fair, I think I'd be a bit naffed off if all carbonated drinks had to be served from plastic or glass bottles and not on tap. Come on TUI, this is a busy hotel, you can't expect staff to serve drinks like they're at a kids' party! Same for the restaurant area. The poor servers have tiny little workstations - no wonder there were a few spectacular crash/tinkles.
Overall, however, it's a lovely hotel, with some fun - but not too full on - entertainment, and quiet spots for those that want it. Add on the Lionesses winning whilst we were there which turned the Fountain Bar into an impromptu jamboree venue and would I recommend this place to friends and family? Yes!",Tripadvisor
Marrakech,Hotel,Iberostar Waves Club Palmeraie Marrakech,"Fantastic Food, Disappointing Drinks!","We’ve stayed at quite a few all-inclusive resorts over the years, and overall, this one ranks pretty highly, I’d have given it 3.5 stars if that were an option. The setting is gorgeous, the food was genuinely impressive, but a few recurring issues held it back from being a full 5-star experience.

🌟 Highlights
Food: Easily one of the best food offerings we’ve had at a resort like this. The tagine station was consistently delicious, the daily BBQ was a treat, and the desserts were indulgent. The later meal times were handy too. The only downside was that the menu could’ve used more variety over the week.

Grounds & Pools: Beautifully kept with lots of greenery. The Zen Pool lives up to its name, very relaxing. The main pool was lively but never chaotic.

Atmosphere: Outdoor dining was really great with mist sprays keeping things cool. The bar area had a charming “town square” vibe with blooming bougainvillea, really lovely.

Staff: Warm, friendly, and helpful overall. A special shout-out to the on-site medical team who helped me free of charge out with an eye infection and a wasp sting (those little guys are everywhere and i ended up in hospital last time I was stung). On one occasion, however a barman at the Zen bar did mock my accent, which wasn’t great.

Entertainment Team: Loads going on during the day and early evening. The main evening shows weren’t to my taste, I went once and slipped away after 15 minutes, but others seemed to enjoy them. During their weekly White Party they started packing up half way, which was a bit strange!

😕 Letdowns
Drinks Offering: This was the biggest disappointment. Very limited spirit choices (many common ones missing), weak pool cocktails that tasted like squash, and staff often unwilling to make drinks they had the ingredients for. Self-serve drink stations often had no cups, and replenished meal-time wine was warm once the chilled bottles were gone. With just a few more staff and better stock management, this could be vastly improved.

*Beds & Room Comfort: The bed was really uncomfortable, two small mattress protectors that did not fit and a loose sheet that ruffled up nightly. Not ideal for restful sleep. Other minor room issues (balcony door didn’t lock, safe didn’t work, shower gel holder fell off the wall) were eventually fixed, but still frustrating.

📝 Things to Keep in Mind
*Shuttle bus drops you about 25 minutes’ walk from the Medina centre.
*The hotel is a bit remote, some activity providers won’t do pickups from here.
Had to go back several times to get room cards reactivated.
Noticed some guests getting preferential treatment, sunbed and table service, while we were overlooked entirely. It could’ve been language-related, but it didn’t feel great.
Very limited shade by the pools, and fixed umbrellas mean little flexibility.
Management was open to feedback when I submitted a form on our last day, which is a good sign.

This is a lovely hotel in many ways, the food, the setting, the friendly staff really stand out. I just wish the drinks had lived up to the standard set by everything else. A few tweaks would take this from good to great.",Tripadvisor

food was amazing and different everyday
Kids club looked great we just didn’t use it.
There was a subbed war towards the end of our stay as it got busier only for the ones closest to the pool steps, they were the best ones if you have young kids!
Bar staff work extremely hard especially in the heat. 
Room’s cleaned daily the hotel was very clean intact
Night time entertainment was great but it was extremely hot when we went and it’s of course outside so 36° at 9pm it’s the best! So much to do there! highly recommend and would definitely go back",Tripadvisor

Marrakech,Hotel,Iberostar Waves Club Palmeraie Marrakech,"Lovely hotel, brilliant staff, drinks could be better.","This is a really nice hotel and we’ve had a great week as a family of 5. 
There are a few pros and cons… 
Pros - there was never a fight for sunbeds we always managed to get one at the kids pool at 9.30 and no drama going to reserve one and then for breakfast. 
The restaurant times were good so you could have a little lie in and still get decent food, same in the evening if you like staying in the pool until closing time there was still hot food being brought out at 9-9.30pm. 
The entertainment team are fabulous they work so hard all day and night getting people involved without being overbearing, round the pool and in the evening. 
The staff are all so nice, friendly, helpful and I didn’t see any bias towards French or anything but obviously they can all communicate much better. If you can tip the bar and waiting staff they are so appreciative and they work so hard! 
The food is always plentiful… at times a little repetitive but I’m a fussy eater and always managed to find something. 
Cons - the drinks… we are familiar with the Iberostar brand and this is why we booked this particular hotel as we know the food and drink is always good however sometimes the beer was flat and cocktails were pre mixed. Brands were extra. 
The food truck only did burgers at lunch and then waffles/pancakes in the afternoon and it wasn’t self serve so resulted in long queues. Same with the drinks it’s help yourself but waiting in long queues to ask for a cup - the bar staff seemed stressed at times. This could be avoided by having paper cups for soft drinks. 
I felt there could have been more of a kids station in the restaurant as we had a 4 year old with us and sometimes we would take a burger in with us for lunch so she could eat with us. 
Overall it’s been a lovely week and the staff really made it so lovely. 
Side note which is nothing to with the hotel but wish id known - the airport is awful, long queues for long times and no air con.",Tripadvisor

Marrakech,Hotel,Fairmont Royal Palm Marrakech,The Place To Stay,"Everything about the hotel is fantastic from the staff to the rooms to the facilities. 
On arrival all
The staff are very welcoming and helpful with luggage. We were given welcome drinks from the bar before heading to the room where are luggage had already arrived. 
The room was huge with the garden view situated on the ground floor. 
Walk in shower and separate bath were excellent. Double sink with large mirror covering the walls. 
Walk-in wardrobe also included within the bathroom area. 
The pools were huge, apparently largest in Marrakech. Pool are was kept clean with a lot of maintenance staff constantly up keeping the grounds. 
The hotel was quiet during our stay so plenty of sun lounges. 
The staff couldn’t do more to help and we had a good chat with imad behind the bar. 
The concierge arranged private taxis to and from the city with pre agreed rate. This was helpful as we were advised the small yellow taxis aren’t allowed to leave the centre of Marrakech. 
The taxi service was excellent and highly recommend all travel using them. We were given a WhatsApp chat to communicate to driver so we could arrange pick up spots in centre. 
The restaurants were all serving amazing food from Italian to Lebanese with prices being reasonable considering the hotel rating. 
The hotel amenities were excellent from the gym to tennis courts. The gym had a good mix of free weights and machines. The spa looked good although we didn’t use this. 
Would highly recommend staying here if planning a trip to Marrakech. The hotel is set within a large complex and there are 2 security barriers before arrival where drivers have to report in making the resort feel extremely safe.",Tripadvisor
Marrakech,Hotel,Fairmont Royal Palm Marrakech,Top hotel,"The hotel, its staff and its golf course are really good. We had a garden suite which was excellent and the room servicing was almost too good. Staff seemed to be checking if we wanted anything almost hourly !!
The bathrooms are enormous and the bed mega comfortable. Endless N'espresso coffee pods and bottles of water. All by charming staff. 
The lighting system in our suite is so complicated. We didn't really understand it after 12 days 😂
We stayed half board and the breakfasts were wonderful but the sparrows and flies on the open food were a worry. We both had upset tummies early on. 
The blurb told us we had three restaurants to choose from but in fact there are only two. A very good Italian   one that serves Moroccan/ Lebanese. Both were very rich food so on reflection we would have done better to go B & B and popped into town for dinners. 
The golf course is really well maintained and suitable for me off 9 and Susie off 25. They try to insist you have a caddy every round, even if you are in a buggy. You can refuse however at £18 a round so what.  
During our stay my wife had a bad fall that required stitches in her head. The hotel were wonderful. They arranged for a doctor to visit immediately who drive us to the local medical centre for scans and tests and the stitches. He then visited us in our room on three further occasions. Very impressive. 
Minor gripes. Hardly any English TV,
No book of what to see and do. You have to ask the concierge everything. 
We had a his/hers massage. Without asking they added 10% service and then lefta space for 'tips' A pet dislike of mine. 

All in all a great hotel.",Tripadvisor

Marrakech,Hotel,Royal Mansour Marrakech Hotel,Best hotel in Africa,"Best hotel I stayed in, perfect in every detail. The service providers are extremely kind and attentive.",Tripadvisor
Marrakech,Hotel,Royal Mansour Marrakech Hotel,Excellence On Every Level,"I have wanted to experience The Royal Mansour Hotel for myself for a long time. I have been fortunate enough to travel extensively throughout my life, staying at hotels of all grades, though my appreciation of those at the luxury end of the spectrum has increased as I have grown older. I have reviewed and assessed hotels for many years and sharing my findings and impressions with people is something I find very pleasurable. Hopefully I have been able to share insight and ideas with my 0.8 million readers.

I saw a documentary about The Royal Mansour several years ago and it certainly captivated my imagination. The hotel is located in the heart of The Medina and is actually a medina within the medina. I found the website to be very helpful in assisting me select the most suitable riad for myself and customer services were very swift in coming back to me with answers to a few questions. I opted for the Premier Riad since it had the highest specifications for one or two persons. I usually travel solo, particularly when I am researching venues.

Whenever possible I like to book directly with a venue rather than through an agency. There are advantages to both methods however this reviewer finds that venues are getting much more competitive in their offers in an attempt to attract customers to book direct. My package gave me a 4-night stay for the price of 3 and I found that to be perfect. Return airport transfers were included, as was fast track through passport control both ways. Breakfast was also included as well as soft drinks from the mini bar. This last point was the only aspect of my stay that did not happen with perfection without the need for me to make daily follow-up requests. The hotel contacted me a few days ahead of my arrival to confirm the arrangements and to identify any specific requirements that I might have. Before I left home I already felt valued.

My arrival was seamless, and as I exited the aircraft and moved towards immigration, I was met en route by the airport fast track representative, who spoke excellent English and was lively and animated. It was a delight to be escorted immediately to an immigration officer who admitted me. I was then handed over to the Royal Mansour driver, Abdelanti, who took me to the awaiting Bentley for the 20-minute drive to the hotel. He was friendly and once again spoke excellent English. He advised me that he has worked for Royal Mansour for 16 years so I believe that says something positive from both sides of the equation.

As I approached the hotel entrance and exited the car, the senior staff from each department were lined up to greet me individually. This was an incredibly personalised and delightful touch. I was seated by a concierge, Mahdi, who served me with mint tea and completed the check-in formalities. He escorted me around the principal locations of the hotel such as the spa and the restaurants, and we then moved on to my riad. I was immediately impressed by the sheer opulence of the building and the high standards to which it was designed, built and furnished. The official check-in time was 15:00 however my riad was ready on my arrival at 11:00 and this was very greatly appreciated.

The ground floor of the riad consisted of a tiled entrance hall leading into an open roofed lounge that had a small fountain. There were comfortable chairs and huge plants and I became instantly aware that I was effectively in my own house. Sliding doors lead into a large sitting room where any guests could be seated comfortably. This led into an internal lounge that was traditionally furnished to an incredibly high standard with tiled floors and high-quality fabric curtains. There was a floral arrangement that was changed during my stay, and a fireplace, a separate table and a fully stocked minibar. The soft drinks were replenished daily, though I did need to remind the hotel each day. The was a high-quality writing desk. All rooms had incredibly high ceilings, and the temperature was individually controlled to a comfortable standard. There was a separate kitchen room that had a microwave and a fridge and more bottled water. There was a toilet on this level and a tiled winding staircase led up to the first floor.

This first floor had an extensive wardrobe and dressing room that was curtained off. A short corridor led to the opulent bedroom that had a wooden parquet floor. The bed was huge and extremely comfortable, with high quality fabrics, pillows and cushions. The bed, linens and pillows were very high quality with a high thread count. There was a small vanity desk by the window and the curtain fabrics were high quality and very effective for blackout. The room benefited from atmospheric lighting that could be individually controlled and had a huge armchair with foot rest. This chair formed a central feature. Again, there was plentiful storage space. Very attractive, floor-to-ceiling carved wooden doors separated a further dressing room that contained a safe. A few rugs and mats were scattered around the room. More carved wooden doors lead to a huge tiled bathroom with a separate toilet and bidet room and a massive shower room. High quality weighing scales were in the room. Two bathrobes were provided and a generous supply of extremely soft and fluffy towels. The room had a massive tiled bath, providing every comfort that could be desired. High quality toiletries were provided.

A further winding staircase led to the third floor, where there was another toilet and a door leading out to the terrace. Views from here were over the roofs of adjacent riads but structured in such a way as to provide complete privacy. It became extremely hot up there during the day and I learned very quickly to be sure I wore the slippers which were provided. On the terrace was a private cabana that provided some protection from the heat during the day. Four attractive tiled steps lead to an upper level, which consisted of two loungers with an umbrella, a fireplace for cooler months and extremely attractive potted plant arrangements. There was a shower and a medium sized plunge pool, which was sun heated and this retained the temperature at night. In colder months the water temperature can be manually adjusted upwards by the hotel. Subtle lighting on the terrace made for a very pleasant experience during hours of darkness. Pool towels were provided and the entire terrace area was extremely relaxing and comfortable. Palm trees were interspersed between the raids.

All rooms had a at least one wall-mounted tablet from which the temperature and the lighting could be individually controlled. There is also a button that control the entire riad with do not disturb signs to the staff. Staff accessed the riad via external and underground tunnels. It took a little adjustment to get used to this but it worked extremely well and the staff were courteous and discreet.

Malika Gargour was my principal housekeeper and she really was sunshine on legs; radiating joy and happiness constantly. My riad was maintained to the highest conceivable standards of cleanliness and brilliance.

There is a large outdoor pool in the complex and also a spa. I did not use these.

There are four restaurants available and breakfast is taken in a delightful outdoor one that provides plenty of shade if desired. A large menu is available and this contains an extensive range of options. The service could not be more welcoming however special mention must go to Mustaffa, who is without doubt especially strong for his warmth and attention to detail. For example, I liked sparkling water to drink and asked for plenty of ice to be provided. A few minutes later, Mustaffa returned proactively not only with ice, but with a small plate of sliced lemon to add to the ice and water. He was the only server to do this during my stay and he displayed an exemplary work ethic. Nothing appeared to be too much trouble for the staff and all requests were received positively. Food items were very fresh and plentiful and refills of anything were freely offered.

I dealt with the reception staff and concierge staff on several occasions and I found these to be extremely accommodating and helpful. Foreign currency could be exchanged at reception and the rate was very fair.

When making arrangements to leave, I was delighted to receive a personalised 6-hour extension to my checkout time as I had a mid-evening flight. This was so helpful and enabled me to take afternoon tea before my departure.

The afternoon tea was extensive and served delightfully, with very fresh products provided. Staff were again attentive.

My stay at Royal Mansour was a true delight and genuinely deserves the five-star rating I have given for the facilities, cleanliness, service and sheer opulence. Although some might consider stays to be expensive, I would defend this by saying that it was perfectly and fairly balanced with extremely high standards that guests enjoy. There are three hotels that stand out with me for providing a complete five star or even six-star experience and both on different continents. Royal Mansour is in joint first place with the other two. I sincerely appreciate the facilities and hospitality that has been offered to me by the management and staff over a most delightful four-night stay.",Tripadvisor

Marrakech,Hotel,Royal Mansour Marrakech Hotel,Arabian nights 🪄,"We knew the Royal Mansour Marrakech would be an incredible hotel, but it surpassed our very high expectations. 

Words and photos cannot accurately convey how beautiful every detail of the hotel is — not surprising given that it’s the King’s hotel. All the tiling and carvings were done by hand and the riad is a truly special home away from home. We have stayed in many luxury hotels — from well-known brands to boutique resorts — and none come close to the Royal Mansour. The food, service and amenities were excellent and the staff were the best of the best. 

We particularly liked how private the hotel is. Each riad has its own pool on the roof. Housekeeping enters through a special entrance and travel via tunnels and passageways so they are never seen when you’re walking around the hotel. No carts in the hall at Royal Mansour!

We were at Royal Mansour for 5 nights, and it was not enough time to see all the amazing sights in Marrakech, go into the desert and Atlas Mountain, and relax by the pool and spa. HIGHLY recommend staying for at least 7 nights, especially if this is your first trip to Marrakech. (Also recommend Adil from Marrakech Desert for an excursion to the desert/mountains.)

In short, the only negative about the Royal Mansour is that it will ruin all of your future hotel stays!!!

You won’t be disappointed!

Marrakech,Hotel,"Mandarin Oriental, Marrakech",Sublime oasis in Marrakesh,"Not quite sure where to start with this review…words like exceptional, incredible, stunning and so so special just don’t do this hotel justice.

Yes it is pricey, probably the only con I can think of because everything else just blew us away. A real life oasis.

From the moment we arrived, we were made to feel so special and the service is incomparable. All the staff, everyone, thank you so much ☺️ .

Then you have the villas of course that kind of takes your breath away.

The hotel gardens, which of course you can’t get a sense of how truly beautiful they are, as you walk towards your villa, all you can smell is jasmine and roses, genuinely, I kid you not.

The main pool is stunning, (I’m running out of adjectives) we had it to ourselves pretty much the whole day we sat by it.

The spa….my fiancé and I both had the traditional hamman which was the perfect way to kick off our holiday, clean off the London grime and prep our skin for some sun.

The food was delicious, our 15 year old son loved Hakasan most, I loved the breakfast, my fiancé loved it all.

Last but not least, Oussama, our Butler, was INCREDIBLE, thank you for looking after us and making our holiday so special.",Tripadvisor
Marrakech,Hotel,"Mandarin Oriental, Marrakech",Beautiful but loud,We went there for our mini moon. Our butler Amine was great and the villas are gorgeous. You are however on the landing path to the airport so you get woken up from 6am. The breakfast was delicious but the service can be quite long. We had an issue with the noise from the AC in the villa but this was resolved by the hotel.,Tripadvisor

Marrakech,Hotel,"Mandarin Oriental, Marrakech",Beautiful,"We absolutely loved our stay at the Mandarin Oriental Marrakech — truly a five-star experience from start to finish! The property is stunning, the service impeccable, and every detail thoughtfully curated to make guests feel special.

The hotel’s location is perfect: just a quick 10-minute drive from the Medina, and the staff seamlessly arranged tours, transfers, and all the details that made our trip so memorable and effortless. The hotel is quiet, peaceful, so pretty and has everything you need!

During our stay, we visited several other high-profile and popular hotels for dinners and drinks — and we were so happy we chose to stay at the Mandarin Oriental. Without question, we would stay here again in a heartbeat.

A special thanks to Amine, who was incredible — always accessible, endlessly helpful, and who made everything so easy, fun, and stress-free. His care and attention truly elevated our experience. We cannot give enough praise to Amine -- he even helped us find the channel showing the Wimbledon final and picked up medicine for my son. 

The best stay we could have imagined — can’t wait to come back!",Tripadvisor

Marrakech,Hotel,Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Great Family stay with excellent service,"We stayed for 7 nights as a family (my wife, two kids, and I) and had a great time. The staff were really friendly and helpful. We arrived a few hours before check-in, but they got us into our room within 40 minutes—and even gave us a free upgrade.

The pool was excellent, like a little oasis in the desert. Some people mention the location, but we didn’t find it an issue. It’s only about 20 minutes from the city center, and there’s a free shuttle running throughout the day.

Big thanks to Hamza in catering, Ahmid by the pool, and the cleaning team—everyone went above and beyond. 
I would highly reccomend this hotel.",Tripadvisor
Marrakech,Hotel,Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,A wonderful hotel where you are completely looked after.,"Sirayane is a beautiful, small hotel on the outskirts of Marrakech. The rooms are very clean, well maintained and generous in size. Our room had its own pool and garden, which was wonderful, although for rooms without a pool there was a good selection of other pools; a heated pool, a kids' paddling pool, an unheated pool and an adults only pool. There were plenty of loungers available for the size of the hotel, so no need to 'reserve' beds with towels. There was also a spa and small gym at the hotel. 
The gardens around the hotel were beautifully maintained - an oasis in the desert.
On our arrival we were greeted with mint tea and there was water, fresh fruit, nuts and moroccan biscuits to welcome us to our room. Each evening a small bottle of water for each guest was delivered to our room for the night/morning. And it was this attention to detail and the extremely high level of customer service that was the stand out for our stay at Sirayane.
The food at Sirayane was delicious with a good selection of moroccan and international fare to choose from. A wonderful selection of fruit, pastries, sweet treats, bread, eggs (cooked however you wished) etc was available at breakfast.  We could not fault either the food or the staff.
Whilst the hotel is a 20 minute drive from Marrakech, the hotel provides a complimentary shuttle bus into and back from the town centre, meaning you can get in and out with ease with minibuses running from morning through to late in the evening.
I have no reservations in recommending this hotel to anyone.",Tripadvisor
Marrakech,Hotel,Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Amazing Place,"I went with my son recently (19th July - 26th). Excellent facilities and location. Staff so friendly. A shout out goes to Saleh (restaurant manager) and his team. Saleh went above and beyond to help my son who is a fussy eater. Dishes were altered etc. 
Food at the Hotel again is excellent. Being a smaller hotel they do not offer a big variety of food as some places do but the difference is they offer a smaller choice and variety but the difference is in the quality. The quality is so much higher and well worth it. I went with Saleh's daily recommendations and they were always so delicious! i recommend the aubergine in the Moroccan starters. 
Check in and out was a breeze and the free shuttle service was frequent and much appreciated!!
Thank you Sirayane for such a wonderful experience! My son loved the garden and the pool!",Tripadvisor
Marrakech,Hotel,Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Beautiful stay,"We have just returned from seven nights at this hotel. A little worrying when driving to the hotel. In the middle of an area that’s under construction but don’t let that worry you. The hotel, rooms, staff, pool and spa are all fantastic. Food / drinks are a little pricey compared to other places but great quality. The pool team are simply the best! Everyone so friendly. The Hammam experience in the spa is a must try!",Tripadvisor
Marrakech,Hotel,Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Lovely hotel but could be improved,"I’ve recently returned from a 4 day break with my adult son. The hotel is lovely. The whole hotel is kept very clean, the rooms are very nice with a fridge and you’ve given a small bottle of water every evening. 
We went half board and the food was excellent however when we did buy lunch it was rather expensive. 
The pool men and the restaurant waiters were superb. I couldn’t fault their service. However the bar staff and the reception staff were rather hit and miss with the pool staff often chasing the bar staff for service. 
The reason I haven’t given 5 stars is its location. The hotel is in the middle of no where and next to a building site. So although they put on a free bus to the centre you can’t walk anywhere at all. There is no shop onsite so you can’t buy drinks or snacks anywhere nearby and have to buy the expensive drinks. The air conditioning unit is in the hall so whilst great it doesn’t blow into the bedroom area meaning that when the heat hit 45 during over visit the bedroom was extremely hot",Tripadvisor
Marrakech,Hotel,Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,A perfect location for a Marrakesh break,"Absolute perfection for a restful week in the African sun

The hotel is stunning!!  In a remote location - don’t be put off by the journey in, there is a lot of local construction due to the upcoming location, but the hotel is set back from the main roads and construction sites - and only a 20 min cab ride from the airport 

Once checked in the team got us into our room early, a pool side room with direct access to the pool thru the small garden terrace. The rooms are spacious, well equipped and impeccably clean with a great AC supply that is definitely needed

The pool area is stunning. With ‘double bed’ sunbeds with a great mattress & pillows. The 3 pool guys are incredibly attentive - will supply towels and move that parasols as often as the sun moves round thru the day. If the main 2 pools get busy there is a smaller adults only pool tucked away  if ever needed - but the main pool area is large enough and quiet enough not to have ventured in ourselves

We stayed half board. Lots on offer at the buffet breakfasts with pancakes and eggs made to order upon request. The evening meals are fantastic. A mixed menu of international and local dishes across all 3 courses - enough for something different every day. The food & beverage team again are incredibly attentive and have impeccable manners - particularly calling the 3 younger waiters who are there for every pouring of wine or water needed!!  Their grasp of the menu is great and can explain the dishes to you- in at least 3 languages!!   Particularly recognise Hatim who looked after us for most of the week - a real credit to the team

We also took advantage if the Spa facilities- clean and cool for a relaxing massage or treatment 

The hotel offers a free shuttle service into the City that is pre booked at reception 2 hrs or more before needed. The cars are punctual and clean - well worth a trip to experience the madness of the souks!!!

Nothing is too much trouble for the staff at the hotel in any position or role they cover. Their good nature and manners are almost embarrassing to cope with, but they deliver it with ease

If we could rate this hotel more than 5 stars we would. Highly recommended and worth the money for such an experience",Tripadvisor
Marrakech,Hotel,Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Excellent hotel but with the sound of construction in the background,"Very nice hotel with excellent staff and very nice food. The evening menu should offer more salads on the menu like the lunch menu, they’d get more people using the restaurant. 

The down side of the hotel is the construction traffic you can hear with loud reverse bleepers whilst sat by the pool, plus the construction going on around the area.",Tripadvisor
Marrakech,Hotel,Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Perfect Retreat for and from Marrakesh City Centre,"We chose this hotel because of its good reviews - now we would like to leave our own.
We confirm the following highlights:
- Staff are unassuming and attentive
- Rooms are comfortable, clean and spacious
- The combination of the location and free shuttle bus into the centre worked well. Not too far (about 15 min) and it served as a welcome retreat from the heat, hustle and bustle in the city centre.

A couple of tips:
- Yes, the timings of the free hotel shuttle buses into the city can be limiting but we found a good routine with two round trips a day that served us well and meant we avoided too many private trips at about EU20 a time. Used the mid-morning shuttle into the city to see sights and returned on the mid-afternoon shuttle to relax in the hotel, use the pools and play pool/table tennis. Then used the evening shuttle to return to the city for dinner, returning on the last or second-to-last one back to the hotel.
- Pick up large bottles of drinking water at a kiosk near the shuttle pick-up on your return journey for a fraction of the hotel prices. :)",Tripadvisor
Marrakech,Hotel,Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,Absolutely Exceptional – A Magical Stay in Marrakesh,"Our stay at this hotel in Marrakesh was simply unforgettable. It’s tucked away in a peaceful location that feels like the middle of nowhere, yet it’s conveniently close to the city center. The atmosphere was calm and relaxing, and every corner of the hotel was spotless. You can really see how much care and attention they give to every detail.

The service was truly outstanding. Everyone made us feel welcome and well taken care of throughout our stay. I especially want to thank Youssef at the pool. He was always smiling and checking on the guests, adjusting the umbrellas to make sure we stayed cool and comfortable. His kindness and attentiveness really stood out.

In the restaurant, we were served by Said, Zuhair, and Hatem , three young and incredibly professional waiters. They were always friendly, patient, and made us feel genuinely welcome every time. Whether we were eating at the restaurant, by the pool, or in our room, they always provided excellent service with a smile.

And the food… absolutely delicious. Every meal was à la carte, beautifully presented, and full of flavor. The quality was exceptional, and each dish had that extra touch of luxury that made dining feel like a real treat.

The rooms were perfectly clean, and the free shuttle to the city center made everything even more convenient. There's also a lovely spa on-site that’s definitely worth discovering if you're looking for some relaxation and self-care.

This hotel is a true gem in Marrakesh. I sincerely recommend it to anyone looking for a peaceful, high-quality experience with authentic Moroccan hospitality. We’ll definitely be coming back.",Tripadvisor
Marrakech,Hotel,Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa,"An exceptional stay, the Sirayane should be the new hotel standard in Marrakech","An exceptional stay, the Sirayane becomes my new hotel standard

I spent 7 nights this week at the Sirayane Boutique Hotel & Spa and I can say, without hesitation, that it was an exceptional experience at all levels. From the moment of booking, the tone was set: in their email, the team wrote to me ""we will have the pleasure of welcoming you to our marrakchi paradise to book you the best welcome ever"". I thought wow, they’re setting the bar high. Well... promise kept, it was really the best welcome ever.

Constant smiles, constant attention. Whether it is the reception, restaurant, room service, bar or maids: everyone gives the sincere feeling of being there to please you. Even on the phone, you “feel” a smile. I’ve never seen a team so warm, so invested.

I was with my son, and they were adorable to him from beginning to end.

We stayed in a suite with private pool: an incredible setting surrounded by olive trees, absolute calm. The rooms are super spacious, very comfortable, very well appointed, tastefully decorated. On the catering side, special mention to the ""Weeping Tiger"", a dish to fall on the ground.

The hotel manager stopped by regularly to make sure everything was going well. One morning we missed breakfast: the team kindly told us that if we had called, they would have gladly brought it to us. This kind of little attention makes you feel unique. Towels that are brought to the pool with a smile, Moroccan cookies with tea... everything is designed for your comfort, without ever being intrusive.

This is one of the most beautiful hotel experiences I have ever had. I will come back, that is a certainty. The Sirayane has become my new hotel standard.

A huge thank you to the whole team for this holiday of pure relaxation.",Tripadvisor

Would recommend to friends and will go again",Tripadvisor
Marrakech,Hotel,Les Jardins de la Medina,Great hotel in great location.,"This hotel was the perfect location for a week’s trip to Marrakesh.  It is in the medina and is in walking distance to most attractions.  If you don’t like to walk then a taxi is very cheap at around £5 per trip.
The staff at this hotel are truly there to give you a wonderful experience and nothing is too much trouble for them.  The hotel is spotless with super comfortable beds and rooms have air conditioning.  Turn down service is available each night where they come and spray your pillows with essential oil of your choice. On arrival you are greeted with a welcome drink and some cookies/ cakes and nuts.
The rooms are all different and unique and this adds to the charm of the hotel.  
The pool area is beautiful and towels available.  If u had to be critical I would say the pool area loungers could be padded which would make them more comfortable but they are fine.  There is an outdoor lounge area on the roof and it is beautiful but not used to its full potential- this should have a bar with drinks and coffee/tea available and more people would use it.
The food including breakfast was delicious and very reasonable. 
I would most definitely stay in this hotel if revisiting Marrakesh.  Well done to all staff absolutely excellent service.",Tripadvisor
Marrakech,Hotel,Les Jardins de la Medina,Great city centre hotel. Just perfect !,We stayed 3 nights at this beautiful hotel. The location is fantastic in the heart of the city but you can come back to the tranquility of the gorgeous pool. The rooms are in keeping with the beautiful Moroccan architecture and are well equipped and very comfortable and very clean . The breakfast was delicious and lots of variety. The dinner menu had both international and Moroccan cuisine. The reception arranged transport each day for us with English speaking drivers who were always very prompt. The reception also gave great restaurant recommendations and made bookings for us outside the hotel. We also did the city waking tour which was also arranged by the hotel and was a great introduction to this magical city. Finally the staff were incredibly friendly and always willing to help but did seem a little over worked at times.

We stayed outside the Medina for most of our holiday but wanted to experience the Moroccan culture at its best and chose this Riad from a luxury UK tour operator's brochure. It did not disappoint and as being a surprise for my husband it added to the magic. The members of the team are beyond professional and welcoming. We were shown around and everything was explained into detail from meal and bar hours to pool location and procedures. The room was on the ground floor, very spacious with a sitting area and a  beautiful bathroom. Shower worked to perfection as well as the air con. The Riad is in a quiet location just off one of the main crazy streets with local vendors. It is approx 15 min walk to the main square and maybe 20 min walk to the Koutoubia mosque. 
We chose to have breakfast on the roof top and it was just great. It consisted of plain omelette, yoghurt and cereals, freshly baked breads, jams, local honey and traditional cakes, served with plenty of coffee and tea at your choice. The owner is well known in the area and received many iconic personalities over the years. We had the pleasure to meet him as well as his hard working grandson who is a credit to the business. Presentable and speaking impeccable English. 
All in all a wonderful experience and if given the chance we would return to Marrakech and stay in this Riad a bit longer. Shukram!",Tripadvisor

The second suite was massive, with your own private terrace with a lounging area and outside shower. The pool is beautiful; the grounds are so well kept that having a cool glass of wine in one of the areas surrounded by greenery after a day at the markets is a beautiful experience. The staff is incredible. Friendly and helpful, and the breakfasts, lunches and dinners all served beautifully and deliciously.

We checked in to a room that was a bit small for our liking.  We were upgraded to a wonderful room.  When I offered to pay the difference between the two rooms, I was greeted with, ""There will be no additional charge"".  So nice of them.  The location of the Riad inside the Medina walls was  ideal.  Just a five minute walk to the alley ways and fun shopping that is the heartbeat of Marrakesh.  A wonderful experience.",Tripadvisor

Marrakech,Hotel,Riad Les Trois Mages,An oasis of tranquility,"A wonderful welcome into a beautiful riad, such attention to detail to create a relaxing and tranquil space. There were a number of different chill out spaces exuding Moroccan charm. We have lasting memories of roof top breakfasts, truly delicious and generous, the best orange juice we've tasted. Aziz and his team were amazing hosts, nothing was too much trouble. He gave great advice which made our stay all the more enjoyable. Would totally recommend and were sad to leave.

From the beautiful breakfasts we enjoyed on the roof terrace each morning to the traditional meal served just off the courtyard, we were truly treated like princesses. On the morning of our balloon ride, Ali graciously accompanied us just before five in the morning and waited with us until our bus service arrived. On my birthday, we were surprised with a pretty banner and cakes left in our room. They also organised a cake for a friend who visited the Riad one evening, allowing us to celebrate his upcoming 40th birthday. This dedicated team made our holiday unforgettable, full of politeness and smiles. Kay and I have never laughed so much. We love this Riad, the staff, and Marrakech as a whole.

Marrakech,Hotel,Riad Les Trois Mages,Impeccable hospitality in a beautiful setting,"This riad is a beautiful oasis of calm and the middle of Marrakesh, with warm and professional staff team who provide incredible hospitality. We stayed for four nights with two small children, and I wish we could have stayed longer.

The location is a short walk from all of the main sites in the Medina, but tucked away from the busiest streets. The rooms and common areas are stunningly decorated, and the breakfasts are generous, varied and delicious. Aziz, the manager, was friendly and very kind to our young children, while Ali who worked mornings and nights was always welcoming and responsive. The whole team was amazing at anticipating what we might need and discreetly providing it before we even knew we needed it. 

The rooftop terrace is a beautiful place to take in the sunset and listen to the call to prayer, and even take a dip (although if you visit in winter note that the pool will be chilly!). I had to work remotely a couple of times while we visited and was always brought a beautiful tray of coffee while I worked, which was much appreciated. We also ordered a dinner at the riad and it was delicious and very generous, and such a special memory to enjoy it on the rooftop terrace. 

We travel independently quite a bit and have stayed in all kinds of hotels around the world, including five star ones, and I can honestly say that we have never received better service and hospitality than we did at Riad Trois Mages. We will return for sure.",Tripadvisor
Marrakech,Hotel,Riad Les Trois Mages,Ideal friendly place to stay in Marrakech,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Les Trois Mages with a group of friends. The owner/manager Aziz and his team including Ali and the girls made us so welcome. They will do anything to help you get the most out of your visit to Marrakech. They organised a memorable trip to the Ourika valley in the Atlas Mountains for us, and they cooked a Moroccan feast for us one night - this was definitely one of the best meals we had in Marrakech. The location is ideal - it is down a quiet backstreet but two minutes walk to the local square, Place Riad Larousse, from which you can enter the souk. We can't wait to return!",Tripadvisor

From the moment the door is opened by the softly spoken Aziz, to the minute you leave, it is nothing but fabulous. The rooms are stunningly beautiful and styled with Moroccan furniture and artefacts, and the beds are very comfortable. Breakfast is a vast array of breads, jams, eggs, yoghurt etc and to eat it on the rooftop with a view over Morocco is amazing. If you are up early enough, you can watch the hot air balloons rise gracefully into the morning sun.

Marrakech,Hotel,Be Live Experience Marrakech Palmeraie,"Fantastic 7 night stay, wish it was longer","We stayed here for a week and we wished it could have been longer. 

1 negative that needs to be addressed imo is the sunbed situation. Our 1st morning there, I woke up at 6.45am and reserved the last 3 sunbeds!! After this, it got earlier everyday, it wasn't great.
The other small negative was lack of bar staff at the pool bar. Very often it would be just 1 person so the queue could become big. 

Hasna at reception was so friendly and helpful. 
Be aware there is a £40 damage deposit which is held not taken from your bank until you check out. Towels are a £20 deposit pp until you hand them back but can be changed daily. Also a tourist tax. We paid £21 for 2 adults and 1 child for a week.
This hotel is very relaxed, great vibe around the pool, this isn't the biggest but it has different levels which is good for adults and kids. Also have the kids pool with 4 slides and water features. There is a relaxed area for over 16's, loads of sunbeds and a help yourself bar. Plenty going on, darts, ping pong, water polo and so on, although the football team was for adults only. Perhaps could have been more for the kids other than kids club.
Entertainment staff are fantastic, Pitchu the stand out. He's brilliant with all the guests and really happy all the time.
Fatima and Omar at the pool bar were great, always smiling, nothing was too much for them. 
There are so many wasps at the pool bar but all they are interested in is the syrup, they are not at all interested in humans. I've never seen anything like it but it really isn't an issue.
Our room was just a double room but was great. Loads of space and a huge bathroom. A safe, which is free to use, we had a garden which was nice too.
Evening entertainment was really good, quiz night was fun, karaoke night was interesting, a welcome show on the Monday (fire show from Pitchu the highlight). 
Soufaine at the inside bar was great, very happy chap, if there was a cocktail you wanted and the ingredients were available he would make it for you.
Drinks in general were really good. Plenty on offer.
Anyone complaining about the food clearly have a boring appetite. There was so much variety, fish, meat, vegetarian etc. kids corner was good also. Loads of desserts and ice-cream.
I read a review about the restaurant that they left because the menu was ""small"". It was arguably the best meal I had. Food was unbelievable. Highly recommend, book on arrival.
There is a free shuttle to the market, it is chaos but well worth a visit. Do the morning 1st as it's quieter, the evening is very busy. A polite ""no thank you"" will keep them off your back. Also, haggling is a must as they start high.
We visited the water park and did a camel ride with sunset and a meal. Both superb excursions, booked via the app ""get your guide"". Very reasonably priced.
We loved Morocco and will look to return one day in the near future. 
Overall, a superb stay for us in a very chilled environment.",Tripadvisor
Marrakech,Hotel,Be Live Experience Marrakech Palmeraie,A great place to stay for a family but get more sun beds,"We had a great holiday. Great food and good shuttle bus into Marrakesh. Friendly staff, great room and great value for money. The camel riding and quad biking excursions were great. 

Cons: music a bit too loud, we had no sunbeds the first few days until we realised you needed to set an alarm at 6am to get a sunbeds. 

The a la carte restaurant was a bit pointless, very few items on the menu and was a bit naff. We left and went to the great buffet instead. 

Pool is a bit too small for the amount of people but overall we had a great time.",Tripadvisor
Marrakech,Hotel,Be Live Experience Marrakech Palmeraie,Amazing Experience at the resort - 7 Day Visit,"Pre-Arrival Information
Check-in: Monday, July 28th at 3:00 PM
Costs to expect upon arrival:
City Tax: 231 MAD for 2 adults and 2 children.
Refundable Deposit: 1300 MAD for the room and 4 towel cards.
Tip: Book the à la carte restaurant on your first day to avoid delays.
Free Shuttle: The hotel provides free bus tickets to the old town market.

The food was excellent, with a different menu each day. We particularly appreciated how helpful and accommodating the hotel management was regarding my son's nut allergy, ensuring he had a variety of safe meal options throughout our 7-day stay. Drinks and nightly entertainment were also plentiful.

We took part in a number of daily activities, including darts, water pong, water polo, and water aerobics.

On our fourth night, we enjoyed a meal at the à la carte restaurant. The kids loved the chicken strips, fries, and a vanilla dessert afterward.

We pre-booked the shuttle to the Old Town the night before, as you need a ticket to board. The bus left at 9:30 AM and returned at 12:30 PM, giving us about 2.5 hours to explore and shop. We chose this time because the weather was cooler than midday.

Be aware of vendors with snakes and monkeys on the way to the market. A firm but polite ""La Shukran"" (No thank you) is all you need to keep them from bothering you. When shopping, remember that prices are aimed at tourists, so be prepared to haggle for at least 70% off the initial asking price.

Noise: Rooms near the main hotel can be loud due to music until midnight, which isn't ideal for families with young children.

Kids' Club: The kids' club could be improved. The staff didn't seem very engaged with the children, leading to a lack of interest. It was also not offered on our first day.

Drinks: The hotel could do with a few more bar staff particular in the morning by the pool as it could take a few minutes for you to get your drinks.

Sunbeds: This was huge. Like most hotels there are not enough sunbeds. Although the hotel has a policy to not reserve we still found everyone would wake up from 4:00 am on ward and lay there towels on the beds.",Tripadvisor
Marrakech,Hotel,Be Live Experience Marrakech Palmeraie,Great Family Holiday.,"We (two adults, four children from 17-14) spent 10 days here in July and had a fantastic time. We had two duplex rooms and they were brilliant family spaces, particularly as they had two bathrooms, a must with 4 teenagers. Our rooms were cleaned daily and to a high standard, as were the public areas of the hotel too. It seemed like the cleaning staff never stopped.

We found the food in the restaurant was great and never had any problems finding something we enjoyed, even the fussy 14 year old. The waiting staff were brilliant too, making sure we had what we needed but not hovering over us either. We were also happy with the drinks available too, whether it was the local beer and wine or the soft drinks for the children. The cocktails were fine, much better than in other AI hotels we have stayed in. We ate in the A La Carte restaurant once and it had a limited menu, but everything we had was delicious. 

The entertainment team were fantastic. They were great at getting you involved if you wanted to but equally respected your choice if you didn't want to do the activity on offer. The poolside was definitely lively but not obnoxiously so. The highlight for the 16 and 14 year old was the daily water polo game :-)

The reception team were also great, they had to reset our keys several times and always did it with a smile. They also helped my partner ensure we had the right place pinned on maps when we were off into Marrrakech for a guided tour and booked our taxi for us. We also used the courtesy bus a couple of times to go into the city and it was fine. You do have to book it in advance but this isn't a problem. 

Our main and only gripe was the sunbed situation. I was 'lucky' on two days and managed to get 4 together at about 8:30am but apart from that we never managed it and usually ended up setting ourselves up at a table at the snack bar. This wasn't a major problem for us because the teenagers weren't too fussed but would have been more of a problem if the children had been younger. There clearly aren't enough sunbeds and then some people are selfish and reserve sunbeds early but don't use them at all. We witnessed beds with towels on empty for hours. However, if the pool staff were notified of this they did remove the towels. We actually set up camp in the adult only area on our last two days, despite having two under 16s with us. It is essentially an unused space because there is only one umbrella up there so we were (mostly) the only ones up there. 

Overall, we would recommend this hotel and would definitely stay here again.",Tripadvisor

Food amazing always plenty of choice, rooms large and really clean, pool lovely, plenty of activities.

Marrakech,Hotel,Be Live Experience Marrakech Palmeraie,Lovely family holiday - Sunbed nightmare!!,"Pros;
The hotel is clean and lovely well kept gardens,  the reception staff are good and will help sort out issues. Most of the bar staff are happy and pleasant except 2 that are rude and clearly favour French & local over the English ( i won't name & shame). Duplex rooms are good   the 2 bathrooms are great for family's. Cleaned daily with fresh towels/water.
Food hit & miss for us as we have a couple of fussy eaters but there is always the snack bar.
The entertainment is not the best they do try and are very enthusiastic. picco ( not sure of his name) steals the show he's so talented and clearly males up the entertainment.
There is nothing for kids out of the pool, the park area is only accessible via the kids club and is in direct sunlight so unable to use it as its only open a few hours a day and it's not the best. Could really do with some children play area in the shade small park for the kids to play.
The gym is small but good equipment and it was never overcrowded. 
We have had 2 good days of music around the pool DJ one day and another day it was English mix from 70s /80s to modern but just 1 day 🙄.Aqua gym is hit & miss the guys are great. We are still here are having a good time the hotel would be perfect if they addressed a few issues.
Cons;
The sunbed situation is a nightmare, 6am I was up today and there was about 15 beds free I don't blame people as if one does all will otherwise you will be on the grass. There is plenty of area for more beds and considering there is nothing outside the hotel they need to sort this, same in the evening there is clearly not enough tables & chairs but there is room for more.
There is nowhere to have a little walk to nothing for miles the supermarket is about 1 hour round trip ( not woth it ) hence why the hotel shop is very expensive. £16 - £24 for suncream so bring plenty. 
We booked the restaurant last night and have our 2nd visit booked for tomorrow we will be cancelling the food was shocking and my family said the worse they have had since we came 😬.
Would i come back - not until the sort sunbed & seating. I wouldn't come for our main family holiday as not enough to keep the kids entertained for ourselves, and 10 days here to long without good entertainment.
Overall we have had a lovely family holiday and made happy memories..
Tips: 
Bring  insulated cups with lids ( staff happy to fill ) 
If you can't get q bed borrow the ones from the adult section as its hardly used 😊 oh and the tent up there has not been cleaned since we got here vodka bottles and litter been there over a week now.. ",Tripadvisor

There was a clear lack of activities and play areas that could engage the smallest. The only pool available was both too small and too deep for smaller children – making it stressful and insecure for parents. It seemed as if families with children were not a priority, and the staff did not seem to pay much attention to the needs of the children.

Marrakech,Hotel,Les Borjs de la Kasbah,Perfect Stay,"I’m 3 months late to write a review , as promised to Nora but better late than never— this place truly deserves every bit of praise.

On our arrival, we were welcomed with a basket of fresh fruits and a glass of the most refreshing mint tea — a perfect introduction to the hotel’s warm and traditional charm. The interiors are beautifully styled with an old-world aesthetic that immediately makes you feel both relaxed and immersed in local culture.

Nora was an exceptional host — always polite, gentle, and genuinely helpful. She guided us on the best places to visit and even shared some practical tips on how to negotiate in the local markets, which made our excursions so much more enjoyable.

One of the highlights came at the end of our trip. Our flight was in the late afternoon, and after an early excursion, we had a few hours to spare in the heat. With our luggage safely stored in their drop-off room, Nora and her husband kindly allowed us to spend the few hours in their library. It was a cool and quiet sanctuary — my wife even managed to get a good nap on the couch while the sun blazed outside. It’s this kind of thoughtful hospitality that really stays with you.

The only thing to keep in mind: if you're taking a taxi from the airport, make sure the driver drops you directly at the hotel, not at the entrance of the kasbah. Otherwise, you may end up walking almost half a mile with your bags — not ideal after a long journey.

All in all, I wholeheartedly recommend this hotel for its traditional charm and, above all, its incredibly kind and attentive staff. Thank you again, Nora — we hope to visit again someday!

We were disturbed at the evening show that the dancers were quite intrusive, even if they were clearly made to understand that you want to eat in peace.

Heard so many great things about Comptoir, however failed to live up to its expectations for us. The restaurant theming is beautiful, with a great atmosphere and live music. However, lights are not popular here. Be prepared to use a torch light to read the menu. Service was great to start then slowed down considerably when the restaurant got busier. For whatever reason the waitress didn’t seem best pleased when we asked to pay by card. Must prefer cash tips.. The food itself was okay at best. Lamb tacos were nice, along with the weeping tiger steak, but neither was warm. The meatball tagine was very dry also. The caramel fondant for dessert was the highlight. Beautiful. What you pay for a meal here, in my opinion, doesn’t compare to what you might find in the Medina. One final point, dress code on their website is not enforced.",Tripadvisor

There is not much missing from this address to be in my eyes better, up to its note. Even to raise prices a little but have home fries and baker burger breads.

Marrakech,Restaurant,Dardar Rooftop Cocktails & Eat,"Great food, great atmosphere","Visited for dinner with a table on the roof top terrace in time to see the sunset, which was very special.

Staff very friendly and service excellent.

Small menu but all good choices.  Food was amazing and frozen cocktails good too.

During our visit there was a dj playing good music and also a violinist and some Moroccan dancers.  Our three course meal plus 4 alcoholic drinks and bottle of water came to 176,000 Durham so not the cheapest meal but well worth the money.

Highly recommended and will definitely visit again when next in Morocco.",Tripadvisor

Marrakech,Restaurant,Dardar Rooftop Cocktails & Eat,"Really enjoyed the food, the service and stunning rooftop","The service is extremely good and fast and they could put a fair few large hotels to shame.  The food was also very good, but a little on the pricer side.  The sunset from the roof top was spectacular, so reserve early as it is very, very busy.  Depending on whether you want to eat or just take a drink, you have time slots as it is that popular. On the night we went there was live music which was excellent, but we didn't stay too late - it ramps up later into the evening with a DJ, so a good spot for a few cocktails.",Tripadvisor

We just had dinner and ate very well! The restaurant is cool inside (with air conditioning) and boasts a very nice terrace from which to see the city from above and maybe a nice sunset. The food is very good and after dinner you can attend a dancing show. The bartenders are very nice and the waiters very nice!!",Tripadvisor
Marrakech,Restaurant,Dardar Rooftop Cocktails & Eat,Scam of the century,"What a disappointment! I couldn’t wait to test this place, the setting as well as the food seemed to really stick to an interesting dynamic and a search for taste and pleasure for customers. 

Unfortunately, it is quite the opposite. The quantities are ridiculous, but still this could be compensated by an explosive taste, precise seasoning or a fair balance. Except it’s none of that! Bland, tasteless, flavorless and unbalanced! 
And icing on the cake necessarily the bill! Which hurts extremely considering the experience. 
5€ a bottle of water, for a nice but not crazy setting, a simple service, it gives you an idea! 

I advise against",Tripadvisor
Marrakech,Restaurant,Dardar Rooftop Cocktails & Eat,Pleasant rooftop experience,"Dardar came highly recommended per the reviews and didn't disappoint although not quite full marks. Rooftop experience was lovely, it positively served wine and beers which we've found to be uncommon in Marrakech and the food was very tasty. It was a little on the pricey side and our group of 6 were placed on a table in the middle sitting on backless chairs which became uncomfortable after a while. Worth a visit but insist on chairs with backs!",Tripadvisor

Marrakech,Restaurant,Palais Dar Soukkar,Dar Sukar is a must!,"Booking made for 6 adults for 5 months, deposit paid!
We're coming: what's your name?
We repeat the same name 3 times to the reception staff and we are told: no reservation!
We take out the emails, the evidence and suddenly the revelation .... and the destructive look of the receptionist towards her colleagues who finally found the reservation!
We are seated at a table with bench and chairs from another age, below a platform where groups of young people in more than casual clothing are located while a correct outfit is required on the site of the complex!
Cocktails, choice of menu, wines, ok everything now goes well: I specify to the waiter 3 times that I will taste the wine after my cocktail... he nods... serves me wine... and asks me if it suits me: a joke!
The dishes are of average quality and the service pushes for consumption with the wine bottles that empty quickly!
The show finally begins: singer of good level, fire-breather who does not spit anything... dancers dynamic but of average quality: overall duration of the show of 1 hour, dinner finished, coffee and addition! And there, the room manager asks us to clear the table because we learn that the reservation is scheduled for a duration of 2.5 hours at the table, then we have to get out and either go out, or find a table at the bar!
Little text explanation with the manager, discussion and finally he finds us another table at the bar!
Weird but some tables that arrived at the same time as us, remain in place and are not subject to this rule: we quickly realize that indigenous youth groups are not disturbed: cronies and arrangements?
In short, an evening where the negatives follow with a feeling of not being respected as a customer!
Dar Sukar is a must-see in Marrakech but management and customer relations are not up to the task!
The meals are average, the comfort of the tables and chairs is improved, the show is moderately correct!
All this is sold through social networks and the bling bling highlighted by the establishment!",Tripadvisor
Marrakech,Restaurant,Palais Dar Soukkar,Totally fantastic evening with dinner and show,"Fantastic evening. Surprisingly top class. Extremely skilled DJs and really professional dancers. Great songs that got the audience. The food was excellent - the best we got in Morocco. Take the “expensive” menu. The price of food and drink is higher than elsewhere, but the atmosphere and the show you get with - and it's all worth the money. Do not arrive before 21/21.30 and stay for far beyond midnight. The mood is far from the tourist, as one could fear. It is full of joy and really professional. The sound is excellent - outside under the open sky with light shows and lamps and cozy. Forgotten service that is also unrivalled. Strong servants who actually knew something about food and wine - and made the evening perfect.",Tripadvisor

Our daughter suddenly, as soon as we ordered, was overcome with heat stroke. This waiter - I wish I had got his name - could not have done more to help us, bringing ice in a napkin, medicine, letting her lie down a different area, thank you again for your kindness❤️
My second review is for the experience of Dar Soukkar - it was elegant, the setting was a spectacle, the food good, the service excellent but it wasn’t 100 per cent a Moroccan experience. The belly dancers were very good, but some of the other entertainment choices I would think would appeal more to young boujee phone scrolling 20 something locals. For us to hear Adele or Amy Winehouse songs or see Chicago dance routines.. not so much… we can see that at home. So if you are looking for a truly Moroccan Marrakesh night out I would probably look elsewhere.",Tripadvisor

Marrakech,Restaurant,Palais Dar Soukkar,A mediocre experience despite the festive setting,"We had a great time overall thanks to the festive atmosphere and the impressive setting of the Dar Sukkar Palace. However, several points really marred the experience.

The food is correct, without more, certainly not at the level of prices charged. I found a piece of plastic in my dessert, but the waiter was in such a hurry to clear it that I didn’t even have time to report it.

Barely the last bite swallowed, we were brought the bill without even wondering if we wanted to have something else to drink. Two minutes after paying, a staff member arrived, accompanied by a couple, to ask us to clear the table. No words of apology, just an injunction to ""go to the bar"".

We stayed 1h20 in all. Being in a hurry to leave the table after spending nearly €180 on two people is quite shocking. Too bad, because the place has potential, but the purely commercial approach spoils the experience.",Tripadvisor

The setting is breathtaking — a beautifully restored old sugar palace with grand architecture, candlelight, and lush gardens that make you feel like you’ve stepped into a Moroccan fairytale.

We chose it for a family dinner, and it didn’t disappoint. The atmosphere was elegant but still relaxed enough for us to enjoy with kids. The food was delicious — we shared a variety of Moroccan dishes, and everything was flavorful and beautifully presented. The lamb tagine and briouates were especially memorable.

As the evening went on, the live music and traditional performances added even more magic to the night. It was a perfect blend of culture, fine dining, and ambiance.

The service was professional and attentive, making us feel welcome and well taken care of from start to finish.

Marrakech,Restaurant,Terrasse des Epices,Worst choice,"I booked a table for me and my boyfriend at 18:30, with the intent of drinking something cool on a rooftop that has little and nothing, except the lack of the roof; we were the first customers to access and they made us sit in the center, between black walls and empty tables, despite the “best” tables were empty. We are provided with menus and we opted for a spritz and a beer (being 18:30), specific that we are Italian, drinks arrive and we are asked if we wanted food, but cordially we say no, having a dinner planned elsewhere; 30 minutes pass and again the waiter comes to urge us to take food, which honestly we do not want, he emphasizes, with an air of conceit and a smile on his face, that the consumption is mandatory; very irritated by the ways we take two tapas, once arrived, my boyfriend wanted to get up and leave, without consuming them, irritated by the behavior of the waiter who treated us like waste that could not afford to eat there and for the failure to communicate this 'obligatory expected consumption' but I urged him to stay; they were about to start the evening with the musician, but just finished the food we wanted to leave, we could not wait. In summary I can say that the waiters make an assessment of customers based on what they wear and treat them differently, the prices are high, exaggeratedly for the place where it is located (terrace with black walls, you can not see anything if they put you in the center) , the food is nothing big, all presentation and scene, common flavor, spritz stretched with water. I honestly advise against it, no plus points. I have to put a star on it, but it deserves zero.",Tripadvisor
Marrakech,Restaurant,Terrasse des Epices,Pass your way,"Where to start...  Dinner one evening in June, with two, we think ""The Terrace of Spices"", it's famous, we should have a good evening...! Hop, I reserve, because the place is stormed so much it is THE PLACE TO BE!

Very nice little live music. Friendly and welcoming staff. 
We are offered the map and LA: surprise!!! we are in Saint Tropez! Exorbitant prices! Well it must be really delicious, typical, authentic, who cares to pay for an amazing rooftop experience with a view (I'm still looking for it), right? 
The dishes are coming. Interest-free dishes. Tourist food! In a well-Europeanized place when we just want to be in Marrakech! Because restaurants like this, I have tons where I live. 
It annoys me that people are laughing! In Marrakech, we want softness, human warmth, we want the typical, we want the authentic, we want to forget that guineaty side that we see everywhere!

The menu offers a refined take on traditional Moroccan dishes. We tried the chicken tagine with preserved lemon and olives, and it was absolutely delicious — tender, flavorful, and beautifully presented. The desserts and fresh juices were also a highlight.

The hotel rooms and public spaces are beautifully decorated in traditional Moroccan style and everything is very clean and well maintained. 
The hotel's country club is a great facility just outside the city, great place to go in the afternoon heat to enjoy the pool and relax. 
The food is great, the breakfast buffet has a very wide choice and the restaurant in the evening has an excellent menu and very interesting wine list featuring mainly Moroccan wines, which we rate highly.  We also enjoyed the roof top bar for more casual dining. 
Although we find everything about this hotel to be excellent, the most impressive aspect of La Maison Arabe is definitely its staff. They could not be any more helpful or friendly, they are a real asset to the hotel.

Everyone was special!! I hope to return one day!",Tripadvisor
Marrakech,Restaurant,La Maison Arabe,"Luxurious, authentic and historic.","We were very pleasantly surprised by La Maison Arabe, when booking we didn't study it much but the service was 5* from the moment we booked. The hotel refunded us for an extra day we accidentally booked which was very kind. They knew I'd recently been in a traffic accident in the UK so they organised a 4x4 car to pick us up from the airport for free. The team were highly professional and warm spirited throughout our stay. They helped us organise trips, taxis and offered daily advice. Our room was immaculate, opulent yet homely and felt luxurious. I've tried to recreate our stay at home by buying orange blossom essence, brass hooks and towel robes :)

The hotel has a jazz piano bar and lots of history too. I think Winston Churchill was a frequent visitor. 

As someone who cannot eat gluten or dairy I often find hotel breakfast difficult. However the food was great! I had almond milk in my coffee and plenty of options for food; omelette, fresh figs, fresh beetroot juice, savoury options, fruit, quinoa and more. 

At the time of visiting the pool was under construction so the hotel had an hourly shuttle which took us to their second private property which has a fabulous luxury outdoor pool set in hectors of gardens and in a beautiful setting. I would have liked to have known about this before arriving, but they certainly redeemed themselves. 

My only criticism was that one of the taxis they booked us during the week didn't have seatbelts, but perhaps they didn't know that when booking. And, that the fallback pool didn't serve alcohol like the hotel did. But the lunch we ordered was delicious. 

The hotel is very well located and we mostly walked everyday to our destinations. On arrival we booked a walking tour which was such a great idea as we saw so much of the local area and the guide over indexed on the arts which is our passion. 

I'd definitely return here again!",Tripadvisor

Marrakech,Restaurant,BlackChich,Chilled vibes and amazing food,"We thought we'd try this restaurant after reading the reviews on Trip Advisor and we were blown away by the amazing food and friendly service.
The restaurant is on the main street Riad Zitoun el Jadid, leading to the main square. We were staying nearby so it was an easy walk. 
My daughter ordered the Maffe Beouf which she said was really tender and lean, there was a peanut sauce underneath and it was served with rice. I had the Yassa Poulet which although I'm not mad about chicken on the bone, was so tender it literally fell apart. The onions were very sweet and absolutely delicious. They don't serve alcohol but my daughter said banana smoothie was one of the best she'd ever had, I had lemon schwepps. We ordered a bottle of water then two coffees and shared an enormous slice of gooey chocolate brownie which was absolute heaven. The atmosphere was chilled with some great music playing in the background and the young serving staff were friendly and attentive. We thoroughly enjoyed our meal and wish we'd had time to visit again, all the above came to about £42.00 worth every penny.",Tripadvisor

We ate zucchini fritters  and beetroot and goats cheese salad to start which were edible but uninspired and for mains the worst marinated grilled chicken we had in a long time, dry  tough and tasteless.

The setting is calm and peaceful after the buzz of the souk just outside the entrance.  Prices were reasonable and portions adequate.
Our only complaint was the booking process (usually necessary for a downstairs table, although you can walk in for the upper levels which are just as pretty when we ate there last year).  Having to send a bank transfer as deposit was a costly endeavour for us (as we dont have paypal) and we felt other options like giving credit card details should have been adequate like many other cities accept.

Marrakech,Tourist+Attraction,TUI BLUE Medina Gardens,Unforgettable honeymoon with great food and amazing staff!,"We had a fantastic honeymoon here. If you're looking for an all-inclusive right in the middle of a city, this is the place to go. You'll be pampered by all the staff, fun activities are organized, the food is amazing, and the staff are incredibly friendly.

And if you want the best cocktails, make sure to visit Hamza and Abderahmane. Wow, such great guys and their cocktails are truly the best in the resort!

Thank you to everyone at TUI Medina Gardens for an unforgettable week.",Tripadvisor
Marrakech,Tourist+Attraction,TUI BLUE Medina Gardens,Shocking decline in the space of 12 months,"We came back to Medina gardens for the second year in a row, having had such an amazing time last year. The 2 experiences couldn’t have been further apart. 

The air conditioning in the room was all but useless, even after having it on all night the temperate was still 21-22 degrees, with 40 degree plus heat outside it was extremely uncomfortable and difficult to sleep. We spoke to reception, someone came to clean the filter, which was absolutely filthy, but it made no difference. 

We purchased day beds so we could have some shade. On the Sunday, the beds by the main pool were all booked so we booked a bed by the relax pool. When we got to the bed, not only was it completely broken but there were no cushions on it. The bed was broken in the middle so both sides tilted towards the middle, the back section was completely broken off so we had nothing to lean up against. When we spoke to the lifeguard and asked for some cushions, he told us they were in the laundry. 

Upon check out we told the receptionist we didn’t use the bed on Sunday and asked them to remove it. I then had to wait over 30 mins on our last day for the manager to seek out the lifeguard and ask him. She then came back and told me they could not remove it from my charge as we didn’t let them know on the day and that it had already been charged to my room. We had booked a bed for the final day, so I asked if that could be refunded, the manager agreed, I paid the bill. 

Twenty minutes later the same manager came out to the pool to our bed and told me we had to pay for the bed! I refused. 

Service in the main restaurant was slow and poor, as was the food. 

We paid for a jacuzzi for our balcony; hardly any of the jets worked, the plastic surround was tatty and dirty, we only used it once. 

The WiFi was shocking. At least 50% of our stay we had none. It kept going in and out which was frustrating when you’re trying to listen to music or an audiobook by the pool. 

The resort wreaks of cost cutting and is no longer a premium facility. 

The only positive was the service of the guys making cocktails in ‘the bar’ they were brilliant, so friendly and excellent service. 

Needless to say we will not be returning next year.",Tripadvisor
Marrakech,Tourist+Attraction,TUI BLUE Medina Gardens,"Beautiful, clean, friendly hotel.",Third time here but first time during Summer as usually come for New Year's Eve. Staff are friendly and helpful. They really do want you to enjoy your time. Food is excellent with great selection and very fresh. I did email hotel 3 times over a 4 month period before arriving in order to request room upgrade but never had response. Our room experience has got worse each time we come here.  Another thing to note is we asked for late check out and paid for this but was only given one option till 6pm. When looking on app we saw we could have checked out 2 hours earlier (which fitted with our flight) and it would have been cheaper. We did tell reception and they apologised. Entertainment staff seem to be enjoying themselves but could have done more to involve people during Entertainment nights. We feel this was much better at new year.  There is unfortunately the same age old issue of the reserving sunbeds at crack of dawn which is a pain and have seen this done so much better at other hotels with app reservations etc. The one morning that the sunbed policy was followed through was much better to avoid the sunbed hoggers who leave the towel and disappear back to bed etc.  Overall this is a beautiful hotel with very hard working friendly staff and we will most likely return again in the future.,Tripadvisor
Marrakech,Tourist+Attraction,TUI BLUE Medina Gardens,An amazing two weeks away.,"Just back from our fourth stay here and it just gets better each year. 
Hotel is in a perfect position for exploring the souks and riads and a very short taxi ride to some of Marrakech’s best spots such as plus61 restaurant or Al Fassia Aguedal. 

We knew that there had been a change of manager this year and with that some staff changes, so wondered if it would have the same family ran feeling, but there were no issues at all. In fact the whole team were incredible. 
From Chef Said and his hard working squad delivering amazing quality hotel food (wait til you see the desserts!) to Aazzedine and Fatima 🥰 looking after us superbly. They have all been here years now and are an example to all in terms of service, politeness and friendliness. 
I swam every morning and called in to the restaurant for a coffee before going back to the room and the daily greeting from Abdullah is worth coming back here alone. Top top guy. 
Moroccan hospitality takes some beating, and this goes for outside of the hotel environment too, but if this hotel lacks in any 5star refinery then it’s made up for in spades by the people. 
From the warm welcome by Abir, Chawki and the management team after a late arrival, to the great service by the pool bar squad including Abdulwahid and Reda, topped off by the best bar staff in the city in Ahmed, Mohamed and Omar. 
There have been changes to the nightly entertainment, not something we’re huge on, but definitely better, and overall lots of little improvements around the whole hotel which are noticeable. There are even a peacock and hen wandering the superbly kept gardens now, which is a strange sight at first but really adds to the character of the place. 
Padel courts, a heated quiet pool for laps and a great gym keeps you in cake credit (you’ll need it), but if you just want to come away to switch off, enjoy some glorious uninterrupted sunshine with only a 15 minute airport transfer then this is the spot. ( RAK airport was great this year too, so it looks like they have addressed the queuing complaints)
There are so many amazing places to visit in the city and using Medina Gardens as a base is perfect. 
Trips to the secret garden, El Fenn, Kabana, Nobu are all within walking distance and Majorelle area with shops and museums is a 5 minute taxi trip.  Just beware of using InDrive as an uber alternative. Some of the drivers are lunatics! Better to pay the local taxis a bit more for a safer, more enjoyable trip. 
Not sure there’s much more to add and sorry if I’ve missed anyone out but I’m really struggling to think of anything negative to say.

Marrakech,Tourist+Attraction,TUI BLUE Medina Gardens,Another Excellent Stay,"This hotel is serene relaxing and stress free with immaculate grounds comfortable and clean rooms and beautiful sunshine. The hotel is in a great location to explore Marrakech.
My husband and I have recently returned from our third visit to Medina Gardens and it continues to amaze me how in the middle of a city the beautiful gardens and the hotel are so peaceful and relaxing. Both pools are of a temperature that you can get straight in and swim and are of a size that they do not get overcrowded.
The restaurant serves a variety of different foods and they are not the same every night as there are different themes.  The head chef Said serves up delectable delights every night and would give Gordon Ramsey a run for his money.
All the staff are amazing and cannot do enough for you to make your stay memorable.  The pool bar staff led by Mustafa and assisted by cheeky boy Reda, Bada and Omar are contantly walking around the hotel grounds with drinks for the guests and they also remember your favourite tipple.  The restaurant servers Fatima and Armin are quick to fill your drinks glass and clear your table and are friendly polite and professional and nothing is too much trouble for them. Abdula the restaurant cleaner is constantly on the go keeping the restaurant clean and hygeinic.  The restaurant manager Chawki who is new to the hotel and had only joined the staff 2 days before we arrived goes above and beyond with his excellent hospitality. The reception I only visited to change currency and the staff member Moad was extreamly helpful and engaging.
The Tui rep Zenib is very knowledly if you have any questions about places to visit and she does not just sell trips if they are not  suitable and she is always on site at the time her notice states.  And last but not least the owner of the hotel Hassan who also comes on site most days and speaks to the quests to make sure eveything is going well.  The hotel has 24 hour security and the head guard Hassan keeps everyone safe.
I have travelled to many countries and only once in Thailand returned to the same hotel, but for a short flight, a beautiful hotel and grounds, relaxation, excellent food, amazing staff this for me is a hotel I can visit time and time again. We will be back for a forth visit",Tripadvisor
Marrakech,Tourist+Attraction,TUI BLUE Medina Gardens,Good Stay At TUI BLUE Medina Gardens,"My wife & I have just returned from a two week stay at TUI BLUE Medina Gardens. Flying time was three hours five minutes from Bristol and Transfer time to the hotel was twenty minutes or so. We arrived at 21:30 but the restaurant remained open for our evening meal. During check-in you are fitted with your AI wristband.
 
We booked a jacuzzi room and were shown to room 2004.  The bed was large and comfortable - air conditioning worked well and was not noisy. Sleep quality was good although we heard loud music 01:20 one morning but didn't know the source.  Room servicing by the household staff was excellent!    I requested extra coat hangers via the Tui blue app - you can make maintenance and housekeeping requests via the app.
 
Wi-Fi - this was free and good within the hotel buildings but was patchy in the garden area.

Money exchange - change your GB pounds to Dirams in reception - we got and exchange rate of 11.8 to the pound. Don't take Dirams home - it's a closed currency. There is a charity box at the airport .

Pools - we used the quiet pool or the surrounding garden area during our our stay as the main pool was loud and busy.  Reserving of sunbeds is supposed to be against the rules but everyone did it.   Depth was 1.5M all areas .Get pool towels from the towel hut with your blue card.  Towels can be well used but are okay.

There is no drinks service at the quiet pool - you need to walk to the main pool bar for drinks or coffee. Nearest toilets were behind the Culinarium restaurant.

Food - we booked one evening meal at the Culinarium via the Tui Blue App - It wouldn't let us book again during our second week as it says one booking only via the app. We found the Culinarium okay but didn't worry about visiting again as we thought the main restaurant was much better for variety. We didn't use the Culinarium lunchtime for the same reason.

The Restaurant is the main place we ate all our meals - Breakfast was very good for choice with live cooking stations for eggs / omelettes etc. Staff were quick to serve Tea or coffee and clearing the used plates . Juices and various fruits available.

Evening meals at The Restaurant are themed - International , Moroccan,  Indian and seafood to name a few. No dress code is in operation here. Choices again are wide and varied. Fish was always available usually at the live cooking stations- The tagines were always worth a look as they contained meats , fish or vegetables cooked with preserved lemons.   Staff serving wines and water were prompt to ask you what you wanted to drink - All the wines including red, rose ,white and Prosecco were very drinkable.  Bottled or draught beer was good too. There was live music, violin and Moroccan, here some evenings too which was nice to listen to as you ate your meal.

Bar - the main bar and the Piano bar are nice and air conditioned, ( lovely when outside it was 40 degrees) although the piano person only appeared a couple of times a week we really enjoyed listening to him .  Service was good here as were the gin & tonics. AI Cocktails are available - the Pina coladas were very nice.

Entertainment - some nights a quiz or musical bingo was available at 21:00 before the main show at 21:45 in the fountain bar. These acts were mostly good. Bar service was ok. Shows include Moroccan show, live music or live act with belly dancers with fire!

Tours - we booked the 09:30 half day historical tour costing approx £30 each - this included a guide and coach - we visited the mosque you see and hear from the hotel (not inside) - we were then taken to the rear of our hotel (dropped behind the wall at the back of the Padel court to continue on foot)  We then walked through the arch across the road to enter the souks (no stopping to look at the stalls)  to visit  Medersa Ben Youssef Marrakech, a historic Islamic school located in the heart of Marrakech and the Bahia Palace. We walked 5.1 miles in total in the heat of Marrakech, so would not recommend if you have mobility issues.  The coach returned us at 12:30 approx - value 5/10.

Checkout - our hotel pick-up was 17:35  - we asked for a late checkout and this was granted at no cost.  

 There are tip boxes in in reception to tip the various departments.
 
We enjoyed our stay at TUI BLUE Medina Gardens and would recommend it as a destination for your stay.

I hope you find my review helpful!",Tripadvisor
Marrakech,Tourist+Attraction,TUI BLUE Medina Gardens,Beautiful and Relaxing Stay,"This hotel is one of the best hotels I have stayed in. If you're looking for a relaxing stress free holiday this is the hotel for you.
Rooms- Very comfortable beds and all the essentials you need. Cleanliness is excellent.

Gardens/Pools- Perfect. There is something for everyone. Busy main pool but still relaxing. Private and relaxing garden spaces to sunbathe in and a lovely relax pool. The hotel was full capacity and there are no sunbed wars unless you specifically want a certain bed, however that is your choice and there are always plenty of beds available in the beautiful garden areas which I preferred as they had natural shade under the lovely garden trees. 

Restaurant- Could not have asked for more. The main buffet restaurant (the only one we use on our 4nts stay) was faultless. The food was varied and very tasty. Plenty of choice for everyone. What I appreciated the most though after staying in numerous AI hotels is that this one did not have the over busy canteen feel, it is an oasis of relaxation. I can not explain enough how relaxing meal times was at this hotel compared to other AI hotels I have stayed in.

Staff- Amazing!! All of them. I can not name just one, they were all as friendly and helpful as each other and this is the first time I have experienced this in a hotel. They are so helpful and always have a smile on their face despite how busy. They work long hours in high heat and I never heard anyone complain. They are a true credit to this hotel. 

Gardens- Beautiful. The resident cats I loved (as a cat lover) to fellow cat lovers that have stayed here mum cat is doing well and her kittens, saw the staff feed them and they truly do look after the animals there which I appreciated.

Entertainment- The usual AI entertainment which was pretty good. The Moroccan night was a highlight.

Spa- A friend and myself visited and the massage was amazing. The price is very reasonable and the staff were so friendly and accommodating. I would highly recommend a visit.

If you stay here you will not be disappointed. Proximity to Marrakesh is perfect. The staff are all amazing and friendly. Not once did I feel the need to tip all the time, it mode no difference to the experience I received and in turn I made sure that I tipped well in the very convenient tip box for all staff in the reception area. This made the whole tipping process so much more easier and relaxing and to be honest all hotels should adopt this practice, as I am sure people tip much better this was if they do not feel harassed to do so. Please if you stay here tip generously at the end of your stay using this method as all the staff here deserve praise.

I stayed here with friends but will definitely be back soon with my husband who will absolutely love this hotel.",Tripadvisor
Marrakech,Tourist+Attraction,TUI BLUE Medina Gardens,Exelent,A charming and serene spot hidden within the hustle of Marrakech.

Perfect for photos and a short break from the busy souks.,Tripadvisor
Marrakech,Tourist+Attraction,TUI BLUE Medina Gardens,The best holiday for Peace & Tranquility,"Very quick through airport & leaving on the bus within 30 mins, very impressed with this hotel as soon as we walked in, we were led to seats with mint tea offered before being given our room allocation.
The restaurant was left open for us to eat which was lovely after all the travelling 

On our first night we initially had problems with the air conditioning not working, it took 3 phone calls and 2 visits to reception and nothing was sorted. We spent our first full morning trying to sort it out & It took me eventually going to our tui rep who immediately jumped in and offered another room which we accepted, they were amazing both Abir & Zineb very patient with us. It wasn't fun having to repack and move everything but we were so grateful in having air conditioning the rest of the week.
The hotel is absolutely stunning, we loved the gardens and spent most of our time there as it was slightly cooler that the main pool but we used both pools for swimming, no problems getting a sunbed at any time of day. 

Wifi very good - usually get an esim but wasn't needed this time
We ate every day at the restaurant, food was nice and a good variety, our waiter yasine was very efficient and friendly, we really enjoyed getting to know him over the course of the week and nothing was too much trouble for him. 

We dont drink alcohol but soft drinks all from a bottle and quite lukewarm, a pump tap would've been much better for both staff and guests but we did get ice cold still & sparkling water from the machine. 

We did some of the classes with Laura, she is wonderful really put us at ease and was great with the classes. We had no plans to go to the medina square as we were honestly really anxious about it, she really encouraged us to go even just to walk around and gave us lots of tips and we ended up going, she needs a medal for that 😂
We also had a lovely massage, absolutely incredible experience.
Overall this place is all about peace and tranquility with still lots going on, I've never been to the same place twice but I will definitely be returning here and recommending to other friends.
Best holiday I've ever had ❤️ 

Some niggly bits 
The partition wall between the bedroom & shower needs more privacy, for those staying who are not couples it can be a bit awkward having to undress to get in the shower.
Needs more hooks in the room as there was absolutely nowhere to hang any towels or anything.
Mealtimes constantly having to ask for bowls and spoons as they are not on the table
Shower tray needs some antislip on the gloss white tray so slippery",Tripadvisor
Marrakech,Tourist+Attraction,TUI BLUE Medina Gardens,Some like it HOT! Moroccan magic...,"Probably best to start with what's great about this characterful place:
- general vibe. Chilled, no pressure to do anything. If you want/need a place to just 'splat' then you got it. Hearing the daily calls to prayer from within the hotel was fascinating and reminded you where you were -  in the heart of a bustling North African city which is right on your doorstep if you want to explore
- mostly extremely pleasant, friendly staff who clearly work very hard and put in the hours to look after both the customers and the hotel itself. The gardens are lovely with real points of interest and the pool is clean and well kept. 
- the food is great, and I like that if you want 'UK' food (which you really shouldn't whilst here) it's lunchtimes only for chips! 
What could be better...:
- Rooms are a bit tired. Hit with the smell of stale cigarette smoke upon entry. And bits just periodically fell off during our stay - the patio lock, the door lock, the shaving mirror landing in my hand. Our shower door didn't work properly and the handle was covered in limescale. The safe deciding it wasn't letting us in. Minor gripes but expected a bit better. Also, unless you're with your true love, there's not much in the way of privacy with the bathroom being quite exposed to the bedroom area. Towels could do with a refresh, as well, they were quite rough and threadbare. 
- The bar service overall was pretty good, if you're not in a hurry. But the inconsistency in what you asked for (unless it was wine or beer), was quite dramatic. Some times mindblowingly strong cocktails and others had us questioning if there was any alcohol in them. And the pool bar staff were almost mute in their interactions - at least with me. To be fair, I think I'd be a bit naffed off if all carbonated drinks had to be served from plastic or glass bottles and not on tap. Come on TUI, this is a busy hotel, you can't expect staff to serve drinks like they're at a kids' party! Same for the restaurant area. The poor servers have tiny little workstations - no wonder there were a few spectacular crash/tinkles.
Overall, however, it's a lovely hotel, with some fun - but not too full on - entertainment, and quiet spots for those that want it. Add on the Lionesses winning whilst we were there which turned the Fountain Bar into an impromptu jamboree venue and would I recommend this place to friends and family? Yes!",Tripadvisor
Agadir,Hotel,Hotel Timoulay & Spa Agadir,Just ok rather than great.,"The hotel was reasonable albeit a little out of the way of the main area. 
We had half board. This was disappointing as all the food looked great but was tepid at best. It would have been so much better scoring if there had been hot food. 
The Christmas Eve banquet meal was an added bonus and this was a special occasion but again the food was on the cooler side of my taste. 
Room was clean enough once the dust storm had been cleaned up.",Tripadvisor

Agadir,Hotel,Hotel Timoulay & Spa Agadir,"Relaxing Hotel, Wonderful Staff & Great For Beach Holiday!","My husband & I were pleasantly surprised by Timoulay Hotel & Spa. 

From the moment we stepped through the doors, the staff were friendly & easy to talk to, the atmosphere felt warm, relaxing and inviting. 

The rooms were spacious, clean and smelled gorgeous. We had a lovely view overlooking the pool, the sea and Oufella Kasbah mountain side on the 3rd floor. 

We loved that the hotel wasn't too big, so it was lovely to see other guests daily to build a rapport and chat with them. 

All staff, including the cleaning staff, were friendly and professional. One day, the cleaning staff set up an outfit for me on my bed with a face made from grass and flowers!  My husband & I thought it was a charming, creative and funny touch to add to our holiday.

The food selection at breakfast was great and tasted delicious; it set us up for the day. We also loved the lunch and dinner options. 

It was within easy walking distance to the beach - around 5 minutes. A bit further from the city and some other attractions, however, a taxi ride was both easy and quick. 

Easy to set up tours if you need to do so through the brilliant hotel rep. 

We did the camel ride, city tour & quad bikes - all were brilliant tours. 

My husband & I would come back to the Timoulay Hotel, Agadir, and recommend it to others.

Thank you, Timoulay staff, for such a pleasant and wonderful stay!🥰",Tripadvisor
Agadir,Hotel,Hotel Timoulay & Spa Agadir,Great Hotel - Great Location - Everything you need,"From arriving to departing nothing is too much trouble.

Arrival and check in was super simple - We arrived early before the room was ready we were checked in and offered a drink in the bar where a no pressure excursion guy came to show us what trips we could book and what’s around the area, no pressure at all to book any just really useful information… we were given a map with key bits of info should we need them.

Outside the hotel there is always the small orange taxis waiting to take you wherever you want to go.

The location is ok the end of the main promenade up a very slight hill, we walked from the hotel to the very end of the opposite side where the marina is we stopped for a drink half way but was a beautiful flat walk once on the promenade. For the less mobile the taxis are very very cheap.

Hotel 
VERY VERY CLEAN
Breakfast was nice, look outside for the snack hut they serve omelette, fried eggs and waffles on some days… delish 

We were on B&B ate once at the restaurant for dinner as a buffet style for a set price was ok 

Snack bar open throughout the day serving pizza burgers salads etc, breaks the day up to take shade from the sun for a snack 

Pool 
Pool guys work hard to keep the pool super clean and ensure that everyone has a bed and brolly if you want it, we never had any issue getting a bed and never saw any towels laying about without people on them which makes a refreshing change!  

Rooms
Ours was massive, pool
Facing  large bed and great shower

Would I stay here again if in Morocco? 
Wouldn’t stay anywhere else now……so yes yes yes!",Tripadvisor

Agadir,Hotel,Hotel Timoulay & Spa Agadir,Brilliant Hotel.,"Just returned from a 14 night stay at Timoulay Hotel and Spa and I have to say it is a fantastic hotel. On arrival we were greated at the entrance by security who took our suitcases and directed us to the reception desk, check in was quick and easy. We were shown to our room which was on the third floor,  it was very spacious with a HUGE bed, plenty of storage, a smart TV, spotlessly clean throughput and a balcony with a pool view and a glorious view of Agadir. We had opted for bed and breakfast, which was a buffet with plenty of choices, hot and cold options, was always fresh and a great variety of options. There are plenty of loungers round the pool and again everything was super clean. You dont need to take beach towels to the pool as the hotel provides guests with towels, just ask at reception. The bar is well stocked and food can be ordered too.  Located about a 8-10 minutes walk from the beach and about the same to the nearest restaurants and shops. There's also a ship at reception selling everything from postcards and souvenirs to crisps and chocolate. I know I've said it previously but this hotel is spotlessly clean, our room was tidied and fresh towels supplied EVERY day. All the staff from the doorman to the receptionist, cleaners and waiters were super friendly and helpful.  There is WIFI throughout hotel but if the signal in your room isn't great, the hotel can provide you with an additional router! Also use of the safe and Aircon is included!! Honestly just such a great service all round. We had a fantastic time staying at this hotel. There is only one negative and that's the hotel next door. Hotel Borjs, it has a rooftop bar, which has very loud music pretty much every night of the week and it does go on till about 1am, but if you close your balcony doors it does reduce the noise to a level that allows you to get to sleep. This would not stop us going back, we loved our stay, the hotel, the staff, the food, the high level of service and the cleanliness of the hotel were all top quality.",Tripadvisor

Located just 5 minutes from the beach, the hotel is medium sized, which makes it more personal and pleasant, with great facilities.

The pool was checked daily by the lifeguard who took great care in keeping it clean and up to standard. The reception staff were friendly and helpful aswell as the security team which were very welcoming. 

The hotel was lovely and quiet which was very peaceful and made the holiday really enjoyable. It is quite a walk from the main section of agadir beach - possibly 45-60 minutes so something to bare in mind however we walked half way down the beach in 20 minutes to some lovely restaurants and also into agadir bay which had lots of food options also.",Tripadvisor

Agadir,Hotel,Allegro Agadir,Don’t look too closely,"We are here as family of four - 2 teenagers. Having read the reviews prior to arriving, I was concerned about what we might find. Some of these concerns have been experienced - Allegro is very tired. It needs a total renovation. After the first night, I requested a room change. We were originally given two rooms in block 2 that looked out onto a building site. The two rooms we are in now have garden views and a nice terrace. That said, the rooms are very basic and really quite shabby. Stained, old furniture, the curtains are appalling, those in our children’s room are covered in dirt. There is a stale damp smell in both rooms, worse in our children’s room. The towels are thread bare - feels like you’re drying yourself with a Weetabix. The cleaning staff are lovely and do a good job. 
Our children are enjoying the pool area and we haven’t experienced the Bravo team being too pushy or over zealous. The entertainment is very family friendly and nice to see people having fun. 
I mainly use the beach during the day. It is a gorgeous stretch of sand and lovely to see so many Moroccan families enjoying it. Some of the sunbed covers are filthy. It’s a real shame because basic cleaning would address this. 
Although I have been very disappointed with just how basic the hotel is, the staff are great. Very helpful and polite. The dining hall is excellent. The food is varied and very tasty. You would have to be very fussy not to find something you liked! 
The gardens are the stand out of the entire hotel. If the rooms and sunbeds were as clean and pristine as the gardens , the Allegro would be fantastic. Although we are having a good time in Morocco, I couldn’t recommend the hotel. If you don’t look too closely, you can just about get over your disappointment!",Tripadvisor

Agadir,Hotel,Allegro Agadir,Amazing time!,"Amazing time in Allegro Agadir. The hotel is very well kept and run. Although a bit old, the experience has been more than positive.  I highly recommend it! ",Tripadvisor
Agadir,Hotel,Allegro Agadir,Very disappointing needs a renovation,"Good points, great location, bar and reception staff so friendly and helpful. The gardens are beautiful with tortoises walking round and a hawk comes every morning to scare seagulls.
The food is nice and always plenty of choice.
The rooms are disappointing and very basic, The first room was dirty, stained furniture ripped curtain had had a water leak so wallpaper was peeling off and smelled damp. The bathroom door wouldnt close as it was swollen with water damage. 
Second room was better but the cleaning was minimal our floor was never swept or mopped. Bedding was not changed in 10 days just flipped and rotated even though we requested a change. The bedding doesn’t fit the size of the beds we had 2 single matress protectors laid across which moved were very uncomfortable. 
Towels are taken early and not returned till late afternoon.
The patio door kept coming off the track and had to be repaired. There was a leak outside in the corridor which ran under our door smelled awful. 
The poor area is dirty and tiles are broken and uneven.  
Evening entertainment is basic, kareoke, white party, Moroccan night which is repeated so if you saw it week one it’s the same week two. Theres usually only one bar open at a time it’s very difficult to find a seat, bars are over crowded.
I was most annoyed when I returned from check out to find animation team standing over my teenagers pressuring them to leave good reviews. He told them what to say and gave examples he wanted to take a photo of their phone when they had done it! 
Any good reviews about amazing entertainment team are written by staff! 
Not worth 4 stars in my opinion.",Tripadvisor
Agadir,Hotel,Allegro Agadir,Awful experience will not recommend this hotel to anyone.,"Dumped at the gates not shown where to go. 1 out of 4 people on reception seem to know what they’re doing. No information given about times for meals etc. Room basic with the view of a public path that was constantly noisy 24/7. Food was repeated no variety, poor food hygiene, lady cooking flatbreads was actually scratching her ear and face whilst cooking. Kids allowed to help themselves with their hands and then chuck it back if they don’t want it. I was ill for 4 days and am sure it was food related. Doctor was called for me. 
Staff really do not seem to want to be there. The towels are collected from your room early and not returned until the afternoon (never stayed in a hotel where they’ve done that before). 
Hats off to the entertainment team they do try and try and try but please shut up!! 
Never recommending this hotel to anyone",Tripadvisor
Agadir,Hotel,Allegro Agadir,Basic requirements missing.,"If you are coming to the Allegro, im sure you will have a nice time! However, £20 deposit per beach towel, if you dont drink alcahol or fizzy drinks, take a kettle! There is no pure juice, only children's squash. Mostly the bottles of water are not chilled (funny, beer is always cold), you will not get a cup of coffee/ tea in the day unless you walk across the gardens into the main building and up 2 flights of stairs, thats how far it was from our room. There is coffee at breakfast in the dining room, but that's the only time. Otherwise, it's across the gardens into the building and up 2 flights of stairs. There is also huge confusion if there are 4 people in the room (family room). 2 adult beds and a pull out sofa with 1 pillow and 1 single quilt! 3 towel, not 4, 3 glasses in the bathroom, not 4, always 3 toilet rolls which you have to be careful, if your not, wash your hands thoroughly and hope that you managed to get 1 of the 3 hand towels! As i write my review from my bed, im hoping someone from the hotel might again bring an extra bath towel as I've just dried my body and hair on a hand towel so now there is only 1 of those left.
Surely,  it makes sense. we've paid for 4 people. Why do we not have the basic things we need?",Tripadvisor
Agadir,Hotel,Allegro Agadir,Great hotel,Staying in the hotel for 2 weeks. Thx for welcoming thx for all the staff in the hotel they all friendly and helpful. Holiday worth money.,Tripadvisor
Agadir,Hotel,Allegro Agadir,Never again,"Worst holiday we have ever had, it's not relaxing what so ever, the rave music starts at 10am, stops for lunch then stars again until about 5pm, you can not escape it, we tried the private beach to get away, it was ok but sun beds had seen better days and mattress if you could one were dirty as hell, the food was normally cold, very repetitive, no flavour. The entertainment team are relentless in bothering you, when you politely to leave us alone when we are trying to chill out in the evening they say what's rong with us, when we explain again just here to chill out they don't stop, I wasn't as polite again.

So why is there so many good reviews, well if you like your tattoos, like going on the P at 10am, like filling your plate more than once then this is the place for you, forgot to mention the entertainment crew try to get hold of your phone to right there own reviews. I would never visit this hotel or tbh Morocco again.",Tripadvisor

Agadir,Hotel,Iberostar Waves Founty Beach,First time in Morocco and Iberostar,"This was our first time in Morocco and with Iberostar. Everything is completely honest about our time there. 

room: The rooms are exactly like the photos and very large. Our room was cleaned every day to a high standard. The room has a mini fridge that is empty on arrival, a water carafe to fill at the water coolers, and a safe if you decide to pay for this. The bathroom contains shampoo, conditioner, and shower gel that are on the wall in the shower. There is hand soap and body lotion by the bathroom sink. I used these for the week as I am not that picky and found them good enough. If you need them refilled, simply take them off the wall and leave on the bathroom counter. They are a squeeze from the sides, not pushdown. There was no air conditioning when we were there last week as it is their winter, but it was still plenty warm in the rooms and you will more than likely need to leave the balcony door open during the late evening/morning to cool the room down.

staff: The staff are all very friendly, helpful, and cannot do more for you if they tried. If you need anything, just ask and they will do their best to comply to your request. Special shout out to Sa'id in the bar, I shall miss his 'sante!' There are plenty of security staff around the complex so felt very safe. They are good at their job as we didn't have bracelets (reception forgot to give us them) so we were approached about this. Quickly rectified. 

food: There is plenty to choose from even for the pickiest person. Morning involves many different pastries (i.e. croissants, pain au chocolate etc), cereals (corn flake type, cocoa pops, granola etc), yoghurts, fresh fruit, fresh fruit juice, dried fruit, nuts/seeds, bread/rolls, continental meats and cheeses, egg and omelet station, baked beans, mini continental sausages, bacon, large continental type sausages, toastie making station.  There are also a lot of batter type products such as pancakes, crepes etc.  Lunch consists of burgers, chips, toasties, tagines, rice/noodle, pizza, various different meat options, salads, meat/cheeses, fish, chicken, and pastas. The snack bar has the burgers, pizzas, chips, salads, and a few other things if you don't want to go up to the main restaurant. In the evening, similar to lunch, but more options. Some dishes are the same for lunch or dinner, and they can be the same most days. However, a lot of dishes change at the same time. So you might find something you really enjoy and it is always there (chickpeas, onions, raisins, yummy!), and some things you really enjoy may change. Regardless, if you are a typical Brit and don't like to try new things you will be fine and if you like to try new things you will always find new things at each meal to do so. Puddings are also plentiful and varied, and I would recommend the handmade Moroccan donuts which appear at breakfast and during  snack time at the snack bar. There is also plenty of fresh fruit as well at the pudding station. 

The a la carte restaurant is nothing to write home about. You have more choice in the main restaurant. We were expecting different dishes than what you can get in the main restaurant, but this was not the case. If you skip, you're not missing anything and we heard a lot of people the following evening walking out to go to the main restaurant. 

Drinks: If you have the Iberostar app, you will find all the drinks and the drinks menu on this. The menu does not tell you the ingredients for non alcoholic drinks so you will need to ask about this if you are interested in one in particular (recommend San Francisco). If you are looking for something in particular that is not on the menu, I am sure the bartender will make that for you so just ask. The non brand measures are very generous. There is self serve draft beer (5.25%), wines, fizzy drinks, and water at the snack bar, and numerous ones within the main restaurant. There are water coolers on each landing to fill your room water carafe or a refillable bottle if you have brought with you.

entertainment: The team are very hard working, and put on numerous shows and the sports. All very friendly, and I saw many of them taking time out to sit and speak to various guests. We did not partake in the evening events, but everyone that was taking part seemed to enjoy these

Areas for growth
-as someone that has allergies, the additional signs that others have managed to get the hotel to put up was helpful. However, there is no allergy information on the signs apart from the name of the dish. I managed to eat a few mouthfuls of things due to this issue and luckily I do not suffer anaphylaxis, but anaphylactoid so taking antihistamines was helpful. The only place I saw allergen information was in the Moroccan restaurant. This is an area that the hotel can easily remedy by putting allergen symbols on the signs as this will help keep those with allergies safe.
-as someone that has worked in restaurants for a number of years, we were never allowed to wear our aprons etc when going to the loo. I noticed staff going to the loos with their aprons on. This is quite unhygienic, and very easily remedied by enforcing that aprons etc are not worn to the loo. Disposable gloves were still being worn when going to the loo as well. 
-a smoking and non smoking section would be useful, or having all guests that smoke go down to the grounds rather than on the balcony? As non smokers we were constantly being chocked by smoke from smokers that sat near us when on the large balcony. No issue with people smoking, but it would be useful for those that don't smoke to have a section where smoke is greatly reduced. 

General useful information
-the back gate closes at 1am so you will need to use the front gate from that point forward
-the library is located in an alcove behind the ATM in the reception area ( left of the main entrance if coming in to the hotel)
-the petit train appears to come by anywhere between quarter past and half past the hour based on the times I have seen it pass
-rooms ending in an odd number face the back of the hotel (on the left side of the building if coming into the hotel at least).
-As others have mentioned the doors do not close particularly quietly, so be prepared to possibly be woken up by those coming back to their room late
-rooms  located  at the ends of the halls, near the water coolers that are on the landings can be very noisy due to folks coming back to their room and forgetting this area echoes. Be prepared to be woken up due to other guests not being particularly considerate to those that might be sleeping. During our stay, we did not get one full night sleep due to this and the door mechanisms as our room was right beside the landing. 
-when you leave you cannot exchange your money back within the hotel, you will need to do this at the airport. You will need to do this landside as soon as you get to the airport as there is no exchange airside. However, some of the businesses will take your MAD. 
-departure lounge is on the bottom floor on the opposite side of the Moroccan restaurant or just around the corner from the small shops. Plenty of toilets, showers, and a large changing area. There is no shampoo etc or towels so you will need to ask for towels at the reception or use your beach towel before returning, and your own shampoo. 
-Make sure you have a bracelet when you check in otherwise the security staff will stop you. 
-A few evenings a week, there is a few stalls one is jewelry which all looked very nice, and the other is argan oil and soaps etc. 
-There are two outside pools larger one is unheated, the smaller one is heated. 
-there is a list of excursions that you should receive upon arrival. Totally recommend Crocopark even if you don't have children, the guide we had was amazing. We worked out that the price to go there including tickets was cheaper via the rep than trying to get a taxi and pay for tickets. 
-We were told that a taxi to the Souk would cost 30MAD, it probably actually costs about 20, but we always ended up paying 25. 
-plenty of sun loungers still available mid afternoon. There is no need to put towels down, but people kept doing so. 
-Watch out for seagulls, as we were nearly hit twice with their mess

General impression is that this is a good hotel, plentiful food and drinks, and well worth going to particularly for winter sun.",Tripadvisor
Agadir,Hotel,Iberostar Waves Founty Beach,Lovely hotel,"Stayed for 4 nights in room 3140 (pool and partial sea view) thoroughly enjoyed our stay. First impressions, the hotel was extremely clean and the all the staff were very welcoming, courteous and polite. The food was very nice and there was a large variety of cuisine to cater for all tastes. The pools were great and the hotel is located right on the beach with its own private designated area. There is a fantastic promenade which stretches out making for a beautiful relaxing walk. The Moroccan people are extremely warm, hospitable and welcoming. 

This was our second visit to Agadir but we will definitely recommend it and will be coming back. Highly recommend the Spa service at the hotel, Layla was amazing, she arranged for me a  wonderful spa package, It was a real authentic Moroccan spa experience with highly professional staff. Excellent hotel.",Tripadvisor

Agadir,Hotel,Iberostar Waves Founty Beach,Title: Honest Review – Family of 3 JUST returned Aug25,"I’m one of those people who reads a selection of reviews before booking so not to over whelm but to grab a feel of the place, after all you cant please everyone right? – and I have to say, this time the internet didn’t lie. Everything I read before we came turned out to be pretty much spot on. We came as a family of three – two adults and a 14-year-old – for a week of sun, to tick another country off the bucket list, experience the culture and relax.

The Wins
Room Sweet Room: 
Big as per what we read, cleaned every day, but with décor that could tell a few stories from the 90s. Still, plenty of space for us and our stuff (big wardrobes ladies, few shelves for the men), so no complaints there.

Staff Gold Stars: Honestly, the staff were lovely – friendly, helpful, and the bar crew even remembered our drinks. Makes you feel a bit like royalty… or at least a regular.

Drinks with a Generous Hand: Local spirits poured like they actually wanted you to taste them (cheers to that). The rosé from the pool bar was better than in the main restaurant if you like a blush rather than dark and dry; beer quality depended on the pump, but when it was good, it was good.

Food for Days: I’m gluten-free and survived perfectly well – no fancy labelled section, but I found plenty: meats, fish, veg, salads, local dishes, if you know what you CAN eat (which you should do) then you will be fine. 
For breakfasts that ranged from eggs and yoghurt, fruit and VEG (yeah you read that right) to pancakes and continental bits. 
For the rest of the family, meal times consisted of – pizza, pasta, chips, and more carbs than you could wave a breadstick at. 

Spa for the Brave: I treated myself to a 2-hour hammam and massage for £25 JET2 recommended. Glorious. Just… maybe don’t book if you’re shy – let’s just say it’s authentic.

Beach Space: Yes, it was busy, but it’s big enough to cope, plus there’s a roped-off section of loungers for hotel guests.

Kid Security: Under-16s can’t leave the resort without an adult – our 14-year-old was politely stopped at the gate when we tested it. Thumbs up for safety.

The “Hmm…” List
Cutlery Roulette: Some of the plates and glasses came straight from the dishwasher but hadn’t been checked, so food still stuck on there and you’d occasionally get a whiff from a glass that made you swap it quick.

Not-So-Scenic Surroundings: Out of the gate, the area’s a mix – some clean spots, but also run-down streets, half-built buildings, rubble, and no pavements in places. We walked to the marina most nights, along the seafront which was well kept and pretty (about 50 minutes at a wander) just for something to do. There’s a Zara, a sports shop, a few restaurants… and that’s about it.

Beach Cleanliness: Big enough to find your own patch, but don’t expect pristine sands – cigarette butts and the odd bit of litter around.

Cockroach Cameos: We saw a few. It’s abroad – you deal with it.

Toilet Tales: Main area loos were dated. Constantly cleaned, but still didn’t feel it.

Bits & Bobs
Local tax was about £20 for the week.

Weather:
Bizarre is the only word for it. Mornings were cloudy, cool, or muggy – proper “is it even worth putting sun cream on?” weather – right up until about 1pm. Then, like someone flicked a giant switch, the clouds would vanish, the sky would turn postcard-blue, and the heat would crank up to a scorching 35°C. Strange, but we made it work: mornings were for activities and exploring, and by the time we got back to the hotel, the sun was blazing, and we could relax by the pool with our son.

Sunbed Situation:
No gladiator-style “sunbed wars” here, thank goodness. You can claim your lounger whenever you fancy – early or late – and it won’t be moved. One tip though: if you grab an umbrella, put it up. Leave it closed and the pool attendants will whisk it away to someone else. And if you arrive later in the day and can’t find a bed, just ask the attendants – they’ll rustle one up for you.

Décor overall is dated but tidy.

Went to the market – Jet2 rep told us to haggle, but most stallholders weren’t in the mood.

Taxis are everywhere – haggle and you’ll rarely pay over £4 a ride. Hotel taxis cost a little more.

Everything’s walkable – the longest you’d need to go is about 6km.

Entertainment’s light in the morning, picks up around 3pm by the pool, and evenings always had something going (theme nights, games, music).

Stray dogs are about (tagged, harmless if you leave them be).

Final Word:
If you need gleaming cutlery, picture-perfect beaches, and endless nightlife, you might be disappointed. But if you want friendly staff, easy food and drink, and a holiday where you can relax without much fuss, this place delivers – quirks and all. We had a great week, and most of the reviews I read before coming were bang on.",Tripadvisor
Agadir,Hotel,Iberostar Waves Founty Beach,Lovely pleasant stay - amazing staff!,"We just got back from stay at the Iberostar Waves Founty Beach. So first of all everything was smooth riding. We were welcomed in given biscuits and tea and met by the lovely entertainment team, they asked my name and everyone remembered it for the 10 days we were there!  We had a lovely ground floor pool view which was super handy. 
Food - there is plenty of choice a bit repetative but always plenty to choose from. The donuts at 4pm were ok bit stodgy for me but very very popular and the kids didnt miss a day! The deserts were lovely and again plenty to try. 
Beach - the sand is lovely and sea is warm and pleasent. The only problem we found is that the locals leave the beach really messy which ruined it! There is a closed off part for the hotel which is clean though but you are surrounded by locals, its quiter further down!   
Pool - the pool is a bit dated my kids and many others found it fun counting the loose tiles off the bottom of the pool. One pool is much deeper and was much quieter. 
Staff - they were nothing but amazing! Every single one works extremely hard and are so friendly and kind. 
Trips - we did a few, we went quad biking and in my sons words ""was the best thing ever"" please note children need to be 16 to drive their own but did let my tall 13 year old daughter drive half way through which she was grateful for. We also booked through a website to go horse riding which was ok but it was in a very random place. Still the kids enjoyed it. 
The hotel over all was extremely clean and well looked after. My only concern was on our last morning we were woken by water pouring through the ceiling and the ceiling slow collapsing! 7am and i was running to the front desk. Someone did come quickly but looked and walked away. Thankfully was our final day and it didnt hurt anyone. 

We had a wonderful time and was worth every penny thank you!",Tripadvisor
Agadir,Hotel,Iberostar Waves Founty Beach,Fantastic First time to Agardir and Iberostar,"As a family of 5 this was our first time in Agadir and stating at a Iberostar resort.

We had 2 rooms, sea view. When we arrived we were given mint tea and some lovely biscuits while we filled in some forms. The rooms were ready before the checkin time, clean, and more than adequate for us and view of the ocean was fantastic. There is 1 buffet area which has a huge range of foods, from Moroccon dishes, pizzas, pastas, and the kids favourite - chicken and chips - although the chicken nuggets were a bit tough some days.

It's rare to see all members of the staff do their job with such passion. Always with a smile and willingness to help. From the checkin team, bar staff, cleaners, waiters and especially the entertainment - everyone was amazing and friendly.

We had such a great time, booked some excusions to see the city, a jeep tour (recommended) and paradise valley. All the tourist guides were also amazing, engaging and full of information.

Morocco, Agadir and Iberostar have given us wonderful memories as a family. Thank you to everyone there!",Tripadvisor
Agadir,Hotel,Iberostar Waves Founty Beach,change but...,"stayed DE (11 or 18 / 7) my 2nd time here at this hotel; very big change since the last time ""good and and horrible"".
the room ''3014'' overlooking the pool is very clean and the maid is always there in time to do it again; enough relax at the pool not like the last time you have to be there at 6:00 to reserve a place 
restaurant varies with an option DE Moroccan restaurant and fish restaurant in the evening 
receptionists welcome the room was handed over to us at 2:30 p.m. 
and there the black point DE the hotel the animators rather say amateurs: DE children who turn to young girls who only scream, self-defeat all day without a manager to control them , no activities for adults without talking of the evening commits giving the presentation to people who speak neither French nor English correctly it is really horrible it was bad in the ear , fortunately my children had a good time especially the gran DE 12 years with a host DE maxi club on the other hand with the little ones he had DE girls I don't know they are there for what if their manager is present we see them work but the day DE are off it is of anything children that runs away , the phones , head in the sky .
really to review the changes that will hurt a lot.",Tripadvisor
Agadir,Hotel,Iberostar Waves Founty Beach,Fantastic week,Lovely hotel. Excellent staff. Good location. Wine wasn't good and drinks were weak but the food was  excellent. We stayed for a week. The entertainment staff were great but the nightly dancers got a little boring. It would have been good to see an outside act. We loved the holidays song dances and we all joined in the party vibe. We would love to return and would recommend. Great quality for the price paid. All the Moroccan people we  met on our trip were lovely and it felt safe as a female,Tripadvisor

Agadir,Hotel,ROBINSON Agadir,Poor 1st impression and definitely not for those with mobility issues.,"Arrived and although not expecting welcome drinks would have been nice to have been shown a sign or be given information on how to get a cold drink.  Check in wasn't the quickest. Surprised there are no wristbands for guests as this must be s security issue. No information provided about activities or booking the  restaurant.  The rooms in this hotel are located in apartment style blocks spread out some distance away from the main restaurant, bars pool etc. It is a long uphill walk and then two flights of stairs to get to rooms. No lifts. Once there you are greeted by an empty mini bar and no kettle or tea facilities. One bottle of warm water on the table. There is no customer relations manager. Walked into the main restaurant, no meet and greet and no information on how to get drinks. Really regret choosing this hotel.  I would imagine the mobility issue would also be difficult for those with pushchairs.",Tripadvisor
Agadir,Hotel,ROBINSON Agadir,5 star family holiday,"An amazing family trip.  No wonder voted number 1 by Trip advisor.

Very spacious hotel and despite being full no stress for a sun bed.

It got busy at dinner but there were other dining areas opened, peak season so to be expected.

A wonderful atmosphere and food and staff amazing.  The evening was entertainment was the best I have seen over many years, well done to the entire crew.

We stayed in Block A which is the furthest away from the beach but there is a shuttle golf cart.  We walked every day so we could eat more! :)

Hotel has everything and nothing too much trouble.

We did three trips via our tour operator but we note Robinsons also offer trips.

100% we love the Robinson brand and will look at other destinations.

A great family stay and a message to all please go outside the hotel and enjoy the culture.

Well done Robinsons!",Tripadvisor
Agadir,Hotel,ROBINSON Agadir,Fantastic,"The holiday at Robinson Agadir exceeded my expectations. The rooms, as well as the room service were great, the food was also great. Although the facility is large, ES offers many employment opportunities: Numerous sports facilities, pools and a beautiful beach with sunbeds and hammocks available. My personal highlight was the entertainment staff, especially Rachid. Thanks to employees like him, there was always a good mood and ES never got boring. You can tell that he loves his job and always makes sure that guests feel comfortable.",Tripadvisor
Agadir,Hotel,ROBINSON Agadir,Loved loved loved it ……food heaven.,"We came from a lovely hotel in Taghazout and were hoping the last leg of our Agadir trip would be great…it was 😎. Although Robinsons is a big hotel it is spread out and has gorgeous gardens, banana trees, a rose garden , aloe Vera , hibiscus flowers …..and is right at the end of the stretch of beach flanked by sand dunes which means it is in a quieter end of the busy bustling Agadir bay beach .

We  asked for a room nearer to the beach and this was quickly facilitated by a good reception team The room was super comfortable and I could have easily stayed much longer.

There is a staff training school on the complex which was nice because there were lots of lovely trainees trying hard and doing a great job . We had conversations with several of them who were all charming polite and helpful . We had a lovely waitress called Asmae . The barmen were all engaging and efficient , The  gardeners are doing a phenomenal job.

I had a revitalising peppermint massage in the spa by Norma and it was perfect pressure and prepared me well for my flight home.

I did a good pool aqua aerobics session and next time will try the gym and yoga sessions.

To be honest we had lots of fun just wave jumping ….who needs a gym…….

There is a Souk  bazaar actually inside the complex and we bought our souvenirs there as well as in Souk El Had.
The food is absolutely superb at Robinsons and we are BIG foodies …..the chefs are skilled and we had 5 star food  
consistently from the lovely omelette man to all the lunch and dinner chefs who created deeeeeeluciius meals, many at live cooking stations.

There is a cat project and it was nice to see plump healthy cats wandering around .

Can’t say enough good things about Robinsons Agadir…LOVED IT . Cannot wait to come back .",Tripadvisor
Agadir,Hotel,ROBINSON Agadir,Great time as a solo woman,"I really enjoyed my stay at Robinson despite being more of a German hotel. The room was really spacious, the service and facilities are great. Special high five to Ayoub and Zakaria of the animation team! They brought a special touch to my time spent there, really nice guys and really good at dancing and bringing joy around them. I would recommend even for a solo woman.",Tripadvisor
Agadir,Hotel,ROBINSON Agadir,Unfortunately disappointing,"We stayed with 2 adults and 4 children (9 - 14 years) for a week at Robinson Agadir. Overall, the stay was very disappointing. On DE arrival ES smelled strongly of urine in the bathroom. The housekeeping perfumed on the third day and by the end of the week the smell was almost gone.

The food was mostly just bad and loveless in our opinion. DA we don't eat meat, the choice at breakfast was limited to two types of cheese, fruit, pancakes, oat slime and waffles. ES always had the same dead-roasted and dry fish at lunchtime. ES also had pasta dishes to choose from, which were sometimes ok if one of the chefs felt called to serve. The gala menu at Rob-Carpet was surprisingly good. As a result, we had severe abdominal cramps and stomach problems for days from the following night. Greetings to the tuna tartare at this point. The problems also had some others, as we were allowed to learn later at the pool. 

ES also had an almost constant shortage of plates, glasses and cups. The staff is overwhelmed with the number of visitors and leaves time for food distribution even in long lines. 

ES there are plenty of towels for the pool area. By the sea, the issue is well located next to the restaurant. By the pool, the only towel dispensary is located in the back corner of the shop. If you let the children exchange towels, they come back every day with new ideas. 

The rooms themselves are fine. Of course, the 17 years are noted in the plant. The freshly changed towels sometimes smelled as if they had been dried over a charcoal grill. 

ES was very mixed up by the guest clientele. ES there were some families with children and guests who were DA to celebrate. For us, two guests represented a week. A 70-year-old lady who, when I went to get drinks, sat down with the 4 children and found ES outrageous that I asked her to let me sit down with the family again. Instead, she started smoking quite enjoyably and smoked the children full. We then changed places for six so that the lady could smoke alone. Another early 30s fell completely drunk into our group and also said to the children ""here is all inclusive, you can drink everything"". 

Our impression was that all the staff were very welcoming. Really interested in whether you like it, however, no one has. When asked on the last day at the reception how our transport on the day of departure to the airport would be organized, they answered ""they can check out until 11 am"". That would have been a shame, because our flight left before eleven o'clock.  The ""all-round care"" from the tour operator was completely missing. You felt like you had arrived by car and stayed in some hotel. 

For comparison, we have Robinsonclub Kyllini Beach. There we were completely enthusiastic last year and until the last day. The Robinson Agadir's performance is in comparison a 2-star Hotel Garni, with very poor value for money.",Tripadvisor
Agadir,Hotel,ROBINSON Agadir,Excellent staff,Stayed in May 2025. Second visit to Agadir. Had a tour around The Robinson hotel on our last holiday when staying somewhere else and were determined to come back and try it for ourselves. Beautiful grounds and very clean throughout. As an older couple the size of the complex could have been a problem for us if it wasn’t for the very helpful Bellboys. Especially El Mehdi who was always available to take us where we wanted to go in the golf buggies. Nothing was ever too much trouble and he always had a happy smile and time for friendly conversation. Also this would be the main reason for returning so he is definitely a great asset  to the company!,Tripadvisor
Agadir,Hotel,ROBINSON Agadir,Honestly,"I stayed here with my daughter for one of our  girlie trips 
Initially our rooms were not close to each other but one I asked they moved us immediately the next day 
Even though we are used to a choice of restaurants I can honestly say the  food choice here was really nice. The food was always piping hot and there was almost too much choice 
The staff were always so incredibly friendly and helpful 
The room is large with plenty of storage 
We didn’t have a supplied mini fridge  or coffee maker which surprised us for a four star hotel , we was always given a bottle of water on request 
The pool and beach areas were always kept incredibly clean , 
The evening entertainment is a little bit hit and miss and the cocktails are not great but on the whole I can’t wait to return here with my husband as we had a wonderful relaxing week .",Tripadvisor
Agadir,Hotel,ROBINSON Agadir,A dreamlike surprising holiday.,"The very extensive and varied facility offers fun and games for the whole family. Be it the beautiful Main Pool, the beach or the Sun Downer at the lagoon invite you to relax. 

A very good and large designed indoor and outdoor playground for children is included.
The friendly caregivers will be happy to welcome your children from 3 years of age into the care. 

The entertainment in the theatre and bar is varied. We had a lot of fun. 

The extensive food and beverage offer in the all-inclusive package leaves nothing to be desired. 

The rooms are oriental and modern. We felt super comfortable. 

The staff are very attentive and friendly. 

A little insider tip is the Surf and Turf offer on Fridays in the beach restaurant. For a moderate surcharge, a special high-quality buffet is built for the small group. The sunset with a fantastic view included !

We would definitely go there again. The country is safe and the inhabitants friendly.",Tripadvisor
Agadir,Hotel,ROBINSON Agadir,ENGAGEMENT RING TAKEN FROM ROOM,"We came to Robinson Agadir to celebrate our engagement. My engagement ring went missing the only day we received housekeeping and the way staff handled it was disgraceful.

We were told to come back at 7pm to speak to management. After waiting for hours, we were told they were all at a gala. We had to call the police ourselves. Only when the police arrived did guest relations show up on her phone, laughing, no apology, completely unprofessional. We had to make our own way back from the police station after making a report and after police took photographs of the room, as we did not have much with us because we had to leave in a rush - we even called the hotel to help us get a taxi, they couldn’t even do this!

After constant pushing and specifically asking, we were finally given an informal letter to explain what had happened, it wrongly stated the ring was “missing” when it was clearly theft. We were also promised a list of who had entered our room, then told we weren’t allowed to see it and it would be given to our travel agent, which was not what we were told beforehand.

Staff treated us like an inconvenience from start to finish. No help getting to the police, no updates, no support, no gesture of goodwill, not even basic empathy - apart from one guy at reception I think his name was Robin but we are not sure.

This trip was supposed to be special. Instead, we were ignored and made to feel like we didn’t matter. Avoid this hotel if you value your belongings or expect even basic decency.",Tripadvisor

Agadir,Hotel,Atlantic Hotel Agadir,Good hotel,"I am currently in room 318 for 4 nights.Small hotel that met our expectations, the room is correct, clean, nice staff. Except that impossible to sleep!! At 3:30 am I go down to the reception to try to find a quieter room, but no luck the hotel is full and the receptionist tells me to check with the reception the next morning. We had to sleep 2 hours, noise of passers-by, motorcycles, cars, screams, trucks, people chatting at 4:00 in the morning.
This morning, I return to the reception which offers me to change rooms for an EXTRA for a room on the courtyard side so quieter! they admit that my room is noisy. I obviously refuse to pay extra and be taken hostage. If you book in this hotel it is to the luck or then you have to come in low season to be sure to have a room quiet side.
This is the guest experience I had at this hotel: sleeping 2 hours from 4am to 6am. To hear that you had to pay more to sleep better, this is not what we expected from this hotel, especially since there is no different price category depending on the situation of the room.",Tripadvisor
Agadir,Hotel,Atlantic Hotel Agadir,Very good!!,"The rooms are spacious and well soundproofed. There is a free safe, air conditioning and minibar. The only problem is that the cabinet is not large enough and you have to turn the hangers to be able to open the doors. The staff is very friendly and meets our expectations, the hotel has 44 rooms. Breakfast is okay, with natural orange juice, but they could offer seasonal fruits like watermelon and melon. We were half board and dinner was good quality. As we stayed 17 days, the same menus were repeated the second week. On the other hand, the drinks menu is expensive: the first wine costs 27 euros. With regard to the swimming pool, there is very little space to settle on the deckchairs, but the hotel has the advantage of having a space reserved for the beach, located one kilometer away, with deckchairs and umbrellas. Towels are provided on site. There is also a solarium.
In summary: friendly staff, good service and free parking. I'll be back without any problem.",Tripadvisor

The breakfast is buffet style with a wide range of continental pastries, meats etc including authentic Moroccan options too. The hotel itself is situated about 15 minutes from the beach and 10 minutes from some beautiful parks, we enjoyed both. Agadir is a perfect location for winter sun, great value and the locals were friendly and helpful. On the main beach front, (wide golden sandy beach) there are a variety of restaurants and the marina is a tranquil place to sit and enjoy a coffee. I am sure to return.",Tripadvisor
Agadir,Hotel,Atlantic Hotel Agadir,Nice room but small bathroom,"Hotel staff were great, attentive, helpful, knowledgeable and good communicators.
Rooms were clean tidy, housekeeping was efficient. The rooms were standard size, but we only sleep in ours, so perfectly adequate. The bar area was great, indoor and outdoor, only inside once, before choosing to go outside! The waiter thought we were mad, it’s the middle of January!! Still 17’c at 9pm!! There were other outside seating areas we didn’t use, with TV’s and cover. The pool looked pleasant but actually didn’t see anyone use it! It was in a sheltered courtyard area so didn’t get much sun in winter. The hotel had its own private cordoned off area on the beach that was awesome.
The only reason for a 4 not a 5 was that the building is starting to look a little tired.",Tripadvisor
Agadir,Hotel,Atlantic Hotel Agadir,,"This is a good hotel and the rooms are very nice but the bathroom is rather small. If you have mobility problems this hotel is not for you as there is no lift to the upper floors and even getting into the reception area is difficult.
What we liked best was the pool area where we had our evening meals. The choice of food was very limited (set menu ) but you have the option of ""a la carte""
No kettle in the room unfortunately but there is a minibar. There is a shop selling very reasonably priced beer and wine just a 5 minute walk away.",Tripadvisor
Agadir,Hotel,Hotel Kamal,It is worth repeating,"I think I can't find a better hotel for this price (€500/19days). The hotel is dated. Renovation is in progress. Now 60 rooms and next year the other 60. Breakfast is basic but fine for me. Nice pool in a nice area. The staff are friendly. The rooms are tidy. The location is very convenient. Everything within walking distance. Of course they are. There are nicer, more luxurious and more comfortable hotels but then you enter a totally different price range.
I'll be back here. Already in October",Tripadvisor
Agadir,Hotel,Hotel Kamal,A NIGHTMARE,"We booked one night thinking we’d enjoy a relaxing escape by the pool. What we got instead felt like an accidental booking at a forgotten roadside inn stuck in the past.

The “poolside room” was dark and smelled musty. The stove and sink were rusty, as if they hadn’t been touched since the 80s unless by mold. In the bathroom, we found two random glasses, a 2x1 cm bar of soap that looked more symbolic than useful, and towels with ripped, frayed edges that gave off a strong “used to be white” energy.

Spiders were casually hanging out around the bed, clearly more comfortable than we were. The sun chairs by the pool were dirty and uninviting, and the whole atmosphere felt tired and neglected. The TV? Balanced on a table barely 40 cm high; too small for it and one of the legs was actually hanging off the edge. It looked like one gentle nudge from a toddler would send it crashing down. Practical and safe.
Also beware because those sheets look like bad news (READ THE COMMENTS ABOUT BED BUGS ON GOOGLE )

In short, it was a night to remember,for all the wrong reasons. Wouldn't wish this stay on anyone who values comfort, cleanliness, or functioning Wi-Fi.",Tripadvisor

Agadir,Hotel,Hotel Kamal,Health hazard disguised as a hotel – completely unacceptable,"We booked several nights at Hotel Kamal in Agadir, a month in advance, expecting the double room with pool view shown in the photos on Booking.com.

When we arrived, they gave us a completely different room: 4 single beds, no pool view, and no explanation other than “we’re fully booked.” The balcony door didn’t close, which felt very unsafe on a first floor — anyone could easily get in.

The room had only two power outlets, far from the beds, so we had to hang our phones from the wall to charge. There was no light switch near the bed, so we had to get up to turn off the lights.

But the worst part was the bathroom, which was a health hazard:
• Mold and mildew everywhere
• Paint falling off the ceiling
• Rust, dirt, and grime
• A used toilet paper roll from a previous guest
• Damp smell and zero ventilation

There was no air conditioning, the room was full of mosquitoes, and the overall cleanliness was unacceptable.

When we asked for a solution, the staff gave us none. They refused to change our room, claiming the hotel was full. They wouldn’t give us a complaint form, so we had to call the police and take taxis back and forth just to get one. And even after all this, they still charged us for the first night.

This hotel should not be operating. It is a serious public health and safety concern",Tripadvisor
Agadir,Hotel,Hotel Kamal,Great Hotel,"My husband and I wanted a budget friendly break in the sunshine in Agadir and chose Hotel Kamal based on good reviews, location, price and the fact it had a pool. The hotel is in a great spot in a relatively quiet street, away from the busy seafront, but a short stroll to the beach. There are lots of restaurants and cafes nearby including the lovely Scampi bistro next door, which is licensed. The hotel foyer is really nice with a large, bright lounge area. The rooms are basic, but adequate and very clean. Some have a view of the pool, some of the street. Shower was hot and soap was provided. Beds and towels changed daily. All staff were very mannerly and helpful, particularly Mohammed who manages the pool area. He was just constantly cleaning and very attentive. A wonderful asset to the hotel! Breakfast was again quite basic, but very nice and all we needed (boiled eggs, tomatoes, spreading cheese, selection of croissants, crusty bread and mmsemen, jams, mint tea, coffee and juice). The swimming pool was the highlight of our stay; immaculate, a good depth and size for a swim, surrounded by trees and well maintained plants and with plenty of sunloungers. Mohammed was always on hand with cushions or a beer or coffee from the small pool bar. Other positives about the hotel - checkout wasn’t until 12pm and we could leave our cases in reception and use the pool until our flight time, reception printed our boarding passes for us, we could charge our phones at the poolside. Not really any negatives, but if I had to improve anything it would be hairdryers and tea/coffee making facilities being available in the rooms and a choice about having a balcony (we didn’t have one, despite emailing to request one). Overall we had a wonderful stay at the Kamal and would not hesitate to return. We really enjoyed our holiday.",Tripadvisor
Agadir,Hotel,Hotel Kamal,Nice,Rooms a bit dated but for the price can’t complain. Pool area is lovely with plenty sunbeds and Muhammad that looks after the pool area is a treasure and keeps the place spotless. All staff are brilliant 🤩 would I go back yes I would . It’s about 10/15 minutes walk to the beach which is a lovely area,Tripadvisor

Agadir,Hotel,Hotel Kamal,Central Comfort at Kamal: A Gem in Agadir’s Heart,"""I had a great stay at Hotel Kamal City Centre in Agadir! No complaints at all apart from the check-in receptionist being a bit weird. For the price, it’s an excellent deal—good value with a prime, centrally located spot just a short walk from Agadir Beach and the Amazighe Heritage Museum. The room was clean, a good size, and came with a nice balcony offering views of the bustling city or pool area. The hot shower was a treat after a day out, and the breakfast, at an extra 50MAD, was delicious—offering a buffet with continental options. The hotel itself has a lovely outdoor pool, garden, and terrace, perfect for relaxing. The staff were generally friendly. Highly recommend for a comfortable, affordable stay in the heart of Agadir!""",Tripadvisor
Agadir,Hotel,Hotel Kamal,Best Experience,"My two sons and I just came back from Agadir. It was a birthday trip for my 13th old son. We stayed in the Hotel Kamal City for 3 nights. We had the most amazing time in Agadir and thanks mainly to the wonderful people in the hotel. From the reception staff, a gentleman called Mohammed (who was so kind to help and book the amazing Camel Sunset Safari and BBQ what we thoroughly enjoyed and would highly recommend) but also everyone else at the reception, the two gentleman at the swimming pool area and the breakfast area. Also a special thank you to the gentleman who was cleaning our apartment and the very friendly doormen:). Everyone was kind, accommodating and nothing was too much for them to help. They went above and beyond. The hotel is conveniently located, a 2 minute walk to the main bus stop Valle D'Ouiseaux. There is a little supermarket, Uniprix, just next to the hotel, you can buy really nice souvenirs, French wines etc. A bureau de change is literally next to the hotel with good exchange rates. If you have children and want to go to Crocpark, you don't need to book expensive shuttle buses, just spend 4 dirhams/person and take the bus number 5 and it drops you off two minutes away from the park (just ask the bus driver to let you know when to get out). Also, there are numerous places to eat on the same street (delicious kebabs, Moroccon food or more posher places next to Uniprix ; fresh fruit juices just opposite the hotel). It is just a 5 minute walk to the sea promenade. We stayed in one of the older apartments that are in need of an upgrade but are specious, very clean etc. So thanks again Kamal City Hotel for an unforgettable time thanks to your hospitality:)",Tripadvisor
Agadir,Hotel,Hotel Kamal,Good value for money,"Ground floor room at the pool a little old, lack of maintenance and cleaning, medium soundproofing, very limited but decent breakfast. Nice pool. The welcome is attractive but does not match the room. Hôtel central. For the price was correct but no more. The hotel is under construction at the level of the rooms but not inconvenient. Perhaps this will improve the aging side of the hotel but also the rate. I recommend the hotel for its good value",Tripadvisor

Agadir,Restaurant,Restaurant Jade,Very good restaurant on the beach,"The restaurant had a great look from the outside, but unfortunately, the experience was a huge disappointment. I wouldn’t recommend it and definitely won’t be returning.

When we arrived, several tables were dirty and not properly set. A waiter eventually guided us to a table and cleared it—but then wiped it down with a dirty cloth, which didn’t leave a great impression.

At first, our waiter seemed friendly. He took our order, but then we waited... and waited... and waited. A couple next to us ended up leaving due to the long delay.

We had ordered three drinks—only two arrived, and one of them was wrong. When we reminded them about the missing drink, they brought it—but again, it was incorrect.

When the starter finally came, we were pleasantly surprised that the food was actually nice, which made it all the more disappointing that the service was so poor. We mentioned the drink error (it even contained alcohol, which we didn’t order), and the waiter was rude and dismissive, saying it couldn’t be changed—despite it being their mistake.

After that, we decided to cut our losses and asked for the bill. The attitude from the waitstaff was obnoxious, and we just wanted to leave. At the till, we were shocked to find they had added multiple items we never received. After pointing this out, they adjusted the bill, and we paid and left.

Overall, it was a real letdown. A nice-looking place with poor service, rude staff, and billing issues—definitely not worth the visit.",Tripadvisor

If you like to be stressed out, then stay here! 

The worst possible stay I have had in 20 years! NO Air conditioning working, I changed my room multiple times and still there was no AC working.  

The engineer came to repair the AC, however all he did was push the temp up and down several times and that was it.  Not exactly technical he never returned and when I asked him later on whats going on, he said it was fixed! Nothing of the sort… NO AC! 

As a Platinum Accor member, no amnesties were given not even water in the room.  I requested water several times and in the end, went to buy some myself from the shop outside.

The iron was from the 1970’s with some of the electric cords visible and deep cuts in the earth cable, had I not seen this and plugged it in, I would have had an electric shock.

The bathroom was dismal and no way this hotel can say they are a 5 star! Its really impossible.  You need to use all the towels on the floor to keep it dry because the glass is missing the rubber seal from the bottom, so all the water seeps out, this was present in all the rooms.

The service is absolutely zero, breakfast is a waste of money.  The valet could not find the car for 20 odd minutes only to tell me he parked it in another street and gave me directions to the car. 

I moved hotels to the Marriot Courtyard, absolutely spot on! No issues and they went above and beyond to accommodate me, even I am not a Bonvoy member but for sure shall be!

I am expecting some form of lame excuse from the hotel, as after I checked out they wanted to resolve the issue! A little too late! You lost a customer, not that you care.  For sure I shall take this up with Accor as the hotel falls far beyond the expectations, even the Ibis has better rooms and better service.",Tripadvisor

Casablanca,Hotel,Hyatt Regency Casablanca,Disappointing Hyatt stay in Casablanca.,"The hotel is in need of a total refurbishment and refresh, it is very old, the check in process was arduous and took 2.5 hrs before we were given a room. We arrived 30 minutes before the check in time at 3 pm.
Once we were finally given our room key the room smelt old and musty, so we asked for another room which was only marginally better.
The breakfast choices were lacking and the breakfast area was impractical for eating comfortably, low profile chairs with lower tables to eat on.
On the first full day at the hotel the pool area was closed for a private event for the entire day, the following day we decided to use the pool area, but it was so crowded (because it was closed the day before) we had nowhere to sit and relax so we simply ordered food by the restaurant and the service was terrible. We waited 35 minutes for them to take our order and they forgot half of the items when it was finally delivered. The Chicken was under cooked, until we asked to speak to the supervisor we were not given an apology. You would be well advised to seek alternate accommodations.
Overall experience very disappointing. Not the standards we expected form the Hyatt chain of hotels.",Tripadvisor

Casablanca,Hotel,Hyatt Regency Casablanca,Great Stay,"The location is good--walkable distance to the mosque, medina, restaurants, and train station (Casa Port). The hotel felt like an island with foreigners with the proximity to the medina. We appreciated the sweets upon arrival. We could not use the pool due to some repair going on. The room was rather small and dated. There was a night club in the hotel, which led to some noise in the night. On check out, we asked for a taxi to the Casa Voyageurs station and was told the fare would be around 15 dirhams. The taxi driver charged us 100 dirhams and threatened to take us back to the hotel if we did not pay the amount. This, of course, is not Hyatt Regency's fault but wish there was a way to confirm the amount before taking the taxi.",Tripadvisor

Casablanca,Hotel,Apartamentos Casablanca,"Nice hotel, good price to stay","Myself, and 3 children stayed for a break away.
This holiday was very reasonably priced, for this reason I was worried about how good the hotel was going to be.

Great facilities, pools very good & clean, I see them cleaning every morning, always checking the water out. Always subbed, even in August, no matter what time of day we came
Down we could always get a few beds.

Hotel in general is clean, restaurant, pool, toilets ect. However the cleanliness of the rooms was very average. It was acceptable when we arrived. But the cleaners cleaning the rooms were terrible i couldn’t tell if they had been or not, towels changed every 3rd day, cleaners every other day. Wasn’t too bothered as we kept it clean ourself, but didn’t have a brush to sweep floors other than a tiny brush.

Kids loved the pool game, aqua fit, water sports- shame these aren’t daily.

Silly rules of no floats in the pool, some
Can go in, seems to change daily, no ball games in pool- Seemed like fun police, all the kids on holiday wanted to play with balls and floats but got told off.

Location- great location. 5 min walk down either hill or steps to front, plenty restaurants, cafes, shops, a shopping centre. Beach’s all in walking distance.

Gym- this holiday was advertised as having a gym, the gym is next door it costs €8 per session and have to take a towel or you have to hire one for €3, happy to pay but it doesn’t state when booking it’s not part of the hotel.

Restaurant food reasonably priced and good. Ate a few times but close enough to walk out.

Overall would recommend the hotel.",Tripadvisor
Casablanca,Hotel,Apartamentos Casablanca,Overall very happy,"Everything was very good.
Unfortunately there was no air conditioning in the apartment, only one ceiling fan it the bedroom.
I did see that you could get air conditioning in your room for €10 a day with €20 deposit. So was disappointed by that. But the staff were all lovely and very helpful the apartment was clean and very nice. The pool area was lovely. Food was very good. They also had a great variety of entertainment.
I really enjoyed my stay here...lovely area. Had a great time.",Tripadvisor
Casablanca,Hotel,Apartamentos Casablanca,How to use the fans,"Used this place 4 times since December. It has everything you need and any issues are dealt with within hours.

Negative. Rooms facing the sea now have a lot of music noise from the water park that has opened in the hotel opposite.

The new fans in the bedrooms are really good but confusing to use. You do not need air-conditioning. Press the button below on. Press the top button on the bottom left of the handset. Then press the button in the middle on the left, with 3 dots, until the light goes bright. To switch off the light, press the off button in the top right. This turns off the light not the fan.",Tripadvisor
Casablanca,Hotel,Apartamentos Casablanca,Brilliant,Excellent base for the many lovely restaurants and shops in town. Room was well stocked with plenty of room and a small balcony. Supermarket nearby with everything we needed. Would return again and hire a car to visit the beaches in the south. Nice pool with enough sunbeds not really for swimming just cooling off unless you’re early when it’s empty. Staff all friendly and good service. Everything clean and regular room cleaning. No air con but room stayed cool with just windows open and ceiling fans on. Open air pool complex nearby which is really nice. Quite a few steps to walk up and down to get to town or no steps and can walk on pavement but can get taxis if too hilly. Would certainly recommend. Good value for money.,Tripadvisor
Casablanca,Hotel,Apartamentos Casablanca,Great stay. Short distance to town,"Great stay. Only getting 4 stars only for barman not interested in serving. So didn't bother with food there either. Rooms were perfect. Everything you need. We had family of 5. Plenty of room. Balcony was adequate. Plenty of kitchen wear.
Also helpful friendly reception and cleaners very good.
Pool a bit small but not overly busy so was perfect. Plenty of sunbeds. Didn't appear to be any sunbed hoggers leaving towels and disappearing. Hotel is up a steep hill one way and steps the other.
Consider this if mobility isn't good. But taxis be cheap anyway.

It's in the quieter part of Santa Ponsa but still very close to all amenities.

It was very clean in the public areas and the rooms are cleaned to a high standard every day.

The staff were all friendly and there were plenty of sun beds available at the pools.

There is a safe and a small fridge in the rooms, both free.

However the fridge was tiny and not very cold, so we opted to hire a proper fridge at a cost of 50 euros.

It was well worth it in my opinion as it was very cold, just a shame it didn't have a small freezer compartment.",Tripadvisor
Casablanca,Hotel,Hotel Casablanca,Excellent hotel should be 4 star,"Stayed at Hotel Casablanca for four nights in a junior suite with terrace. Bit disappointed with the view as thought we would be able to see pool and sea as we were on top floor.

We had a massive apartment with separate tv room and a fridge and kettle. (No tea or coffee left so you need to take your own.). Thought there may have been a couple of bottles of water in fridge but none.

The terrace was massive but because of extremely hot weather we didn’t actually use it as there was no shade.

Small bathroom with shower and toilet. Sink was outside of bathroom bit dated. Nice towels.

Comfortable beds with a tv In bedroom although we did not use this at all as used one in lounge a couple of mornings. There was a dressing table with a large mirror. Loads of wardrobe space and hangers. Bedroom door did not close properly. Aircon was adequate.

Cleaner was really friendly and did a good job. Toiletries were a refillable bottle of shampoo and small bar of soap. Again a bit disappointing for a suite.

We were bed and breakfast and found the restaurant to be average as on three of the mornings going down at different times no coffee in some machines, no scrambled eggs just an empty tray. Waitresses were lovely in restaurant. Decided to eat out for breakfast at local Irish bar and it was really lovely would have done that for rest of holiday if we were there longer. Went to pool one day. Pool bar really nice. Had bar snacks and drinks which were nice. Plenty of sun beds.",Tripadvisor

Breakfast was lovely, there were plenty of sun beds no rush to get one or put towels out . The stairs to pool weren’t as bad as they look and sound there’s hand rails to assist also a lift in the next building. Rooms cleaned and mopped every day and regular clean towels also fridge and safe in rooms .

Casablanca,Hotel,Hotel Casablanca,Hidden santaponsa gem,"This hotel is lovely, the location is close to the beach, shops and restaurants. The staff are lovely and the breakfast was great, really pleased with it.

All areas including the pool were very clean. Always sunbeds available and pool well maintained. Daily room clean was good with a change of towels when requested.

The only small downside is the bar prices are a bit more than outside of the hotel but restaurants are so close you can pop out and get lunch much cheaper.
All in all a great hotel, we really enjoyed our break here.",Tripadvisor

Casablanca,Hotel,Hotel Casablanca,I recommend 100%,"Absolutely beautiful hotel. More than a three star hotel. Wonderful staff from reception, cleaning staff and restaurant workers. Always a friendly face. So clean and tidy. Hotel at full occupancy but never felt that way.
Breakfast was very good. Plenty of choice of hot and cold food, pastries and fruit.
Guests have been returning here for over ten years so that shows how good this place is.
Two pools for use of guests. Both clean and at any time of day lots of beds available.
Fantastic gardens which are well kept. Loved Mr and Mrs Duck 🦆 that came for a swim in the afternoon if it was quiet.
Beach about a ten minute walk. Near all restaurants and bars but not close enough to hear or keep you awake.
Lastly amazing air conditioning much required in the extreme heat. I can recommend this hotel and would happily go again.",Tripadvisor
Casablanca,Hotel,Hotel Casablanca,Beautiful quiet hotel..,"Hi, I just got back from 8 days at this hotel and I'm already starting to miss it 😩 Beautiful hotel very clean, maids do excellent hard work bravo👍🏻🫶🏻👌🏻
Breakfast service, reception excellent, very tasty breakfasts, dinner paid extra plus drinks but I think it was a good price because I ate with my family in the city and the bills were higher or even much higher 🤔🙄🫣
If someone is going there this month, you have to know that it is very 🥵 🔥 and it is best to spend the afternoon in the pool, I will point out that it is very clean, good job by the gentleman who works hard every morning, and he makes sure that the guests feel good when using it.👌🏻
Mallorca is not a cheap holiday destination, but in fact, there is probably no other cheap place in Europe 🤔🙄🫣
The view from the terrace was beautiful, especially in the evenings 🤩🤩🤩
The hotel was very quiet and peaceful. I missed some music by the pool. It was in the bar but very discreet. I had to use music from my smartphone.

Casablanca,Hotel,Hotel Casablanca,,"Arrived at the Casa Blanca for a 5 night stay, check-in was easy and the staff were pleasant.

Room: We booked a standard room, which was exactly that, absolutely fine for what we needed but could be a bit small for a longer stay. Room was clean with a traditional style decor and a/c. It had a wardrobe, dressing table, small TV and small fridge, the beds were comfy with spare pillows in the cupboard. The bathroom was very small, with a shower over bath which was very tight to get into, especially if you are on the larger side. The water flooded the floor every time you showered, which is quite dangerous and very slippy! There was complimentary shower gel on the wall and a hairdryer.

Restaurant: Fantastic outdoor dining on the terrace with lovely views. Basic selection of food, but something for everyone, however kids could struggle to find a filling meal or if you're a fussy eater. Drinks were pricey compared to the local bars, which indirectly forced people to spend elsewhere.

Pool & Pool Bar: Steep steps to the pool however there were plenty of sunbeds, no need to save a bed or do the mad AM rush! Pool and pool bar were very clean with a ping pong table in the shade and light music during the day.

Entertainment: Jet 2 advertised occasional evening entertainment but we didn't see any entertainment for the duration of our stay. If drinks were cheaper and they had entertainment guests would spend more time at the hotel and spend more money.

Location: Great location as a base, only 30 mins transfer from the airport, so even better for a long weekend stay. Restaurant and shop opposite the hotel or a short 10 minute walk down hill to the beach, bars and restaurants. Note, guests with mobility issues could struggle with this hotel.

Complimentary Shower Room: The hotel offers 2x complimentary shower rooms to use for 30 mins on the day of your departure, as checkout is at 11am - Bookable on checkout. It's a great addition to have and it was even better then the bathroom in our room! Secure luggage room available to use if you have a late departure.

Conclusion: Lovely traditional hotel, in a good location, ideal for short breaks or a base if you just need somewhere to stay. Not suitable for those with mobility issues due to steep steps to the pool and hills both ends of the road to access the main resort. Food is as expected for a 3* but could find it hard to find something for fussy eaters or children. Drinks could be cheaper to retain guests to spend more on site.",Tripadvisor

Casablanca,Hotel,Hotel Casablanca San Andrés,A memorable experience at Hotel Casablanca – San Andrés,"We stayed DE July 21-27 and unfortunately our experience was very bad from the start. EN reception was poor, with unprofessional staff and, in many cases, poor attitude. They entered our room unannounced, something totally unacceptable.

The room smelled damp, the keys malfunctioned, and overall the hotel is in poor condition, with several sectors under repair and a very old-fashioned style, especially the pool area DE.

The most frustrating thing was that they offer you an “ocean view room”, but if you want a balcony, they charge you an extra 50,000 Colombian pesos POR day, something that was NO previous information.

DE addition, you are automatically charged 10% service, although outside the compound it is indicated that ES voluntary. It's NO DEARTH to pay for it, but if care ES bad, you should have NO choice whether or not to include it.

We also received poor recommendations and little guidance on what to do in the area, which made the experience even worse.

EN summary, this hotel is NO match DE promise. Lack of seriousness, cleanliness, transparency and respect for guests. I'd give it a 1 DE 10 and definitely NO recommendation.",Tripadvisor
Casablanca,Hotel,Hotel Casablanca San Andrés,,"We stayed EN the Casablanca Hotel DE from the night of July 20 until mid-afternoon on the 24th. We arrived after midnight and, although EN that first moment the attention generated some concern —probably POR the hour — everything improved markedly as our stay progressed.

Upon entering the room, we noticed that the internet connection was not working. They explained that it was DE general problem, which was resolved the next day and NO longer failed during the rest DE our stay.

The hotel is located EN te beachfront, in a truly unbeatable location. Having travelled the island from end to end, we confirm that it is one of the best possible locations to enjoy San Andrés, both for the access to the sea and for the proximity to shops and activities.

During the three nights I continued EN dinner in the different restaurants of the hotel. The gastronomic proposal was excellent, both POR the quality DE the dishes and POR the service and atmosphere. We found the value for money very reasonable: a full dinner for two people, with aperitif or beer, is around 80 US dollars, and with Argentine wine, about 90. EN both cases, the price includes the tip. We especially recommend the DE mar sharing grill, grilled salmon, grilled tuna, risotto with pork and mushrooms, and the amazing DE hummus entree with sauteed loin.

Our room was spacious and comfortable, with a king size bed ideal for rest. The bathroom was also very comfortable, with excellent DE water pressure and constant replenishment DE towels and towels – EN several occasions even twice a day – a DETAIL that speaks of the level of attention to the guest.

The DE breakfast was another high point of the stay: complete, fresh and with options for all tastes. Today, before DE retreat, we shared a late check-out and, as a gesture DE courtesy, we were invited with a bite DE assorted stiffs that closed our experience with a DE gilt.

We would like to draw particular attention to the staff. Both the manager, the chef and the manager DE customer service were always present, attentive and available to ensure that every DEtail of our stay was perfect. You can see a real commitment to the well-being of the passenger.

We definitely recommend ENda Hotel Casablanca and hope to come back in the future. Thanks POR everything!",Tripadvisor
Casablanca,Hotel,Casablanca Hotel,Perfectly Quaint!,"We stayed here for our wedding night. 
Beautiful quaint hotel with wonderful service. Original hardwood floors!
We checked in and found a beautiful swan towel sculpture on our bed and tons of faux red rose petals. I mentioned in the booking this was our wedding night hotel-and they followed through with this. So pretty!
I forgot a couple things and the front desk was able to quickly provide- lotion and some blank sheets of paper. So generous.  I think the young lady who was so kind at the front desk was Amina. 
We had a room that led out to the pool. Pretty little private patio with a table and chairs. I wrote out my vows here! 
Loved this hotel!",Tripadvisor
Casablanca,Hotel,Casablanca Hotel,Great stay in Key West,"Great boutique hotel. Very clean, great staff, right on Duval so not far from the action but up the southern end so a quiter section. Near Hemingway House and Southern most point. Continental breakfast provided. Small pool but very refreshing after a long day walking in the sun. Bar/restaurant right next door is excellent",Tripadvisor

They offered breakfast although not included.",Tripadvisor
Casablanca,Hotel,Casablanca Hotel,Nice hotel in good location on Duval Street,"I stayed at the Casablanca for a long weekend in January (Key West 1/2 Marathon).  I chose the Casablanca based on the location and price compared to other hotels nearby.  I was pleasantly surprised with my stay in Room 6.  The room seemed larger than the pictures on the website.  Bed was comfortable, bathroom was clean, and the balcony was a nice area to sit and be outside.  Hotel staff was super friendly and helpful.  The free breakfast was a bonus as well.  Having the Old Town Tavern connected to the hotel was great for lunch and mid-day drink.  Only negatives (minor) are that it got a little noisy one night (but it is Duval Street) and you can hear glass bottles being emptied into the dumpsters.  Overall, thoroughly enjoyed my stay here and recommend the Casablanca!",Tripadvisor
Casablanca,Hotel,Casablanca Hotel,Three days two nights!,"As a family,  there were 3 of us in the double  queen! We arrived early and were able to check in early. A plus!!

Casablanca,Hotel,Casablanca Hotel,Central location hotel.,"This older hotel with a lounge and restaurant on location was a great choice. Central, which we could walk from one end to another of the main street which has mostly everything we came for. A couple of  downsides is the parking and all the rooms in which we saw had stairs. Parking is 7 minutes south. Free but walking after you drop off your luggage. ",Tripadvisor
Casablanca,Hotel,Casablanca Hotel,Great experience,Great place with a clean light room and quiet back yard. Nice coffee and selection of pastries in the morning was a big plus.

Casablanca,Hotel,Casablanca Hotel,I was charged for one night in full for a night I didn't stay.,The parking situation and bed n breakfast was absolutely horrible. On top of that they  charged me in full for a night that I didn't stay claiming they couldn't NOT charge me because of the booking.com reservation that booking.com approved. After booking.com said I was eligible for a refund Casablanca refused to refund me the unstayed night. They are absolutely the MOST HORRIBLE I've ever done business with. DON'T STAY HERE!!!!,Tripadvisor
Casablanca,Hotel,Casablanca Hotel,Stupendously Disappointing,"Outrageously expensive for what it is.The owners clearly spend nothing on maintaining the place.

- Room stank of bleach, which was used to mask the mold growth in the bathroom, behind the bath
- Noisy in the evenings with the Nextdoor restaurant extractor fan running until late
- Single ply loo roll, which says it all
- Supermarket pastries and drip coffee for breakfast

The only positive is that the bed was comfy and the staff hard-working, efficient and kind.

Recommend to avoid if possible as there are better places to be found at more amenable rates.",Tripadvisor
Casablanca,Hotel,Moroccan House Hotel Casablanca,"Convenient, quirky and friendly place to stay in central Casablanca","This is a great place to stay in Casablanca.

Casablanca,Hotel,Moroccan House Hotel Casablanca,Excellent value. Good location. Traditional feel,We stayed for one night before joining a tour as a pair of couples. We booked via booking.com. It was excellent value with friendly staff. I like the traditional feel and Moroccan decoration. It has a central location with atm around the corner. You could walk to the old town and Mosque; we were “accosted” by a taxi driver who offered us a 2 hour city tour which was excellent. The breakfast and central area was traditional and attractive. At first breakfast was hit and miss but staff were responsive and cooked an omelet. It’s all a little ramshackle and slightly dated but hey the price paid it was great. 5 star for feel and value.,Tripadvisor
Casablanca,Hotel,Moroccan House Hotel Casablanca,"Overall, our stay was good. We think we got the most spacious room in the hotel which was great.","We stayed two nights at the end of our tour.
We got a very spacious room on the 9th floor thanks to Chafik. The bed was comfortable with a good firm mattress. Air con kept the room comfortable and there were spare blankets. 
Rainfall shower appeared to be new so maybe has been upgrades.
It had a very Moroccan décor . We  have stayed more than once at the sister hotel in Marrakech.
Clean.
Lift rather slow.
Close proximity to major sites like the Central Market, the old medina, Rick's Cafe and the Mosque which can be toured by foreigners. We had a balcony with a view of the port.
Breakfast very good selection: Dates, olives, cheeses ,breads, beans ,cucumber etc.",Tripadvisor
Casablanca,Hotel,Moroccan House Hotel Casablanca,Bed bugs!,"Cleaning grade 0.
But the real surprise was just the bed bugs. Seen and photographed in the morning. Unfortunately thinking it was just my impression I slept in the haunted bed and a few days later the stings appeared. The manager went up to the room but not having seen them according to him they were not there. 
Bad experience for me anyway. Would not recommend",Tripadvisor

Staff was not very friendly (too little tipped?). Reasonably spacious room, but with the necessary defects: 2 loose sockets (dangerous!), separate shower head, malfunctioning sink ... Great breakfast.",Tripadvisor
Casablanca,Hotel,Moroccan House Hotel Casablanca,Not recommended,"I stayed 3 nights in this hotel because I was on a group trip and the travel leaders booked this hotel for the entire group. I would have personally made a different choice, but the hotel is completely in line with hotel big and old hotels in North Africa. The room and the bathroom were enormous and furnished in the traditional style, but quite basic and some hanging structures are missing. In general, cleanliness must be improved. It was also impossible to get clean towels: both the staff was reluctant in giving new and additional towels (you are only given 2 towels and there's not shower carpet, so you must use one of the towels) and all the towels had stains. Bath products are really low quality. 
The breakfast is ok.
There's a not detectable but constant smell overall the hotel premises.
The hotel has a convenient location, 5 minutes walking from the Casa Port station and 10 minutes walking from the medina.",Tripadvisor
Casablanca,Hotel,Moroccan House Hotel Casablanca,One night stay,"Our flight was changed by the airline late in the game, so we booked this hotel as a last minute addition to our trip.. all of the hotels booked were budget range so we are not expecting all the bells and whistles, just a simple room to stay that is free of pests.. and this is what this place was.. the hotel is very large, the elevator indicated 10 floors.. we were given a room on the 7th floor (75) m, which had partial water views from their balcony.. The shower curtain was not as wide or as long as the open side of the shower, so water got everywhere each time we used it.. breakfast was not included with our suite, so we opted to pay to add it, it was 7 euros per person and included a make to order omelette. A couple bread items were stale and some were fresh.. made us question the freshness of the sausage and cheeses, so we just avoided those.. booking.com had a note saying that the note may or may not charge us a ‘city tax’.. we were charged this, it was approx $5 USD ( not exactly sure of the exact amount but not too bad) for 2 rooms. I was expecting worse as the pics online make the place look really stuffy and dusty, but it was bright and the beds that we got didn’t have the crusty looking lace frill. There was a person that was constantly cleaning the lobby, there was an elevator and a very diligent porter.. it was just ok.. I would try and look for somewhere else at the same price point if looking for a budget stay, if possible.. the place just seems impersonal for some reason.. but it’s still ok to consider as a budget option. After 1 night, we moved to Ryad 91, which we much preferred over this place.",Tripadvisor
Casablanca,Hotel,Moroccan House Hotel Casablanca,DANGEROUS EXPERIENCE,"Reception are bastards
they gave me a single room while we were 2 people !!
they counted extra charge for 2nd person
communication is so bad, impolite, stupid all staffs
no hot water, no wifi connexion
they didnt want to cancel my stay and told me to pay 7 days if I want to go so I CALLED THE POLICE;
The hotel insulted me and behaved in really bad manner. No good manner, really pitiful, I was with an old person and made us wait for a long time. They didnt change the bedroom, they didnt fix de wifi, they didnt want to give me back my passport !!

BE CARREFUL, THEY ARE VERY DANGEROUS. when the police went, they kept saying bad words.

Also, the person who pick the luggage is bad person, he said to us many bad things about the owner but when he saw us leaving just after 1 day, he didnt help for the luggage.

They saw 2 women and they wanted to control us. DONT RECOMMAND HERE AT ALL, this hotel should be reported as dangerous
Stayed only for one night and it was the most miserable stay",Tripadvisor

Casablanca,Hotel,Beach Front Hotel - Casablanca Sayulita,Amazing Stay in Sayulita!,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Casablanca!  The location was great, far enough away from the noise of the main beach, but close enough to walk or a short golf cart ride away.  The staff were super friendly and attentive.  They were always available to answer questions, and went above and beyond to help us if we needed something during our stay.  We loved the pool and the atmosphere of the hotel, very tropical, with lots of wildlife and beautiful vegetation.  There were beach chairs out every day to enjoy.  The parking area had plenty of charging stations for renting a golf cart and was gated in the evening.  Nelson was helpful in the evening with letting us in and helping to get the cart plugged in.  He was super friendly to the kids and made arriving back at night more fun.  

The room was amazing as well.  We loved the small kitchen area with all of the amenities needed to have a meal at the hotel.  The bedroom was cozy, and clean.  The bathroom was spacious as was the shower.  We had two little balconies and a nice view of the ocean from our room!  We will definitely be back in the future!",Tripadvisor

Casablanca,Hotel,Beach Front Hotel - Casablanca Sayulita,Wonderful Stay at Intimate Hotel,"Recently stayed at the Casablanca and had a lovely time. Our group made the mistake of looking at the recent reviews on here and completely panicked days before our trip to Sayulita. We were so pleasantly surprised by everything the hotel had to offer. We had two different room types, one in building A (furthest from the beach) a few floors up, and the other in a building closer to the beach on the ground floor. Both rooms were great. True, the ground floor rooms are a bit darker because of the lush plants on the property, but they're still great rooms. We actually reread some of the terrible reviews while relaxing poolside and found them to be kind of crazy and hilarious. If I had to guess, the people who wrote them have never been to Mexico. We did not have a sewer smell from our bathroom, but the times I have had that in Mexico, it was when I was flushing toilet paper - so it makes me wonder if that was the culprit for folks who have complained about that. We left food out on the counter and did see some tiny tiny little ants the next morning, but they disappeared when we put the food in the fridge. The rooms are bright white, and I loved it, it feels very clean. The sheets and towels were fine, but the beds are quite firm (we never had problems getting to sleep, but they are firmer than I'd like). The pool was clean and the beach is a quick stumble away from even the furthest room. We really enjoyed this hotel and will absolutely stay here again! In our experience, after staying in several hotels and airbnbs in town, this location in Sayulita is the best! The only things I would change are the beds, and I would love if they had some sort of fridge behind reception where you could buy canned cocktails, drinks and snacks!",Tripadvisor
Casablanca,Hotel,Beach Front Hotel - Casablanca Sayulita,Won't be staying again,"We did not have a pleasant stay at the Casablanca Hotel.  In a nutshell, the bed was a board, sheets scratchy, had almost no remaining bottled water and the towels were ripped, stained and threadbare.  The toilet paper is in the same holder and of the same quality as a gas station.  No dish towels and a tv with no remote.  Everything I looked for, was not there.  At every turn, I felt like the owners were saying “we want to spend as little on you for your stay as possible.”  The shame is that it would not take a lot of money to make the rooms quite comfortable; new beds, linens, some decent tissue and ensuring the room is well stocked.  I will say the front desk is helpful and the grounds are absolutely stunning but we won’t be staying again.",Tripadvisor
Casablanca,Hotel,Beach Front Hotel - Casablanca Sayulita,Stay somewhere else,Hard pass…. We went for the new year.  Left 2 days early.  Place was all painted white so everything showed.  Reasonably priced but expected it to be nicer with all the good reviews.  The only place I would stay is the main house where you have access to the pool on the beach.  ,Tripadvisor
Casablanca,Hotel,Beach Front Hotel - Casablanca Sayulita,Nice staffs but...,"Majority of the staffs were friendly and tried to be helpful, the room equipped with the cookware, flatware, mini fridge and a 5 gallon purified water dispenser. I booked a room for 7 days for 4 people. It was not a 5-or 3-stars hotel so I didn’t set too much expectation. Staffs at front desk ( daytime) knows English but the rest of staffs don’t. My standard for hotel is to have a clean room - that's it. Other reviews mentioned the place is dated; it's fine with me. The staffs are trying their best to keep it up, however:

The staircases were not safe for young children, there were trails but the gaps were very big; kids could climb out or fall off from there, so be aware. 

Wifi was slow, as the rest of Sayulita. Do not expect to come here to work remotely if your work requires good bandwidth.

The A/C (heat pump unit) in my room was not working at the night of day 3.  It dripped water for like 30 mins then making noises for another 30 mins - alternating between water dripping and noise making for the rest of the time from 2 am until the next day. I reached (8ish am) out the front desk for help. After a staff fixed it, the A/C was not able to be turned on with the universal remote control on the evening, probably it was reset, not sure.  I was desperate because it was like 38C even at night time, tried to ask the front desk but no one was there except the security guard. He was not able to help because he didn’t speak English. Thus, I returned back to room and tried to figure out what was going on. Then, I realized that the remote control was out of sync/reset. There was no English instruction manual found online for that brand - only Spanish. Good thing was the remote worked the same  way as most of the other universal remote control. Checking some YouTube videos for the setup helped and also figured the “channel” code of the A/C brand from the Spanish instruction manual (mirage brand - code 027 or 028) to sync it back then it worked properly.

Starting on day 4, the room was not provided enough bath towels :( - some reviews mentioned that too. I had 4 people but only 2 towels provided. I went to ask the front desk (around 8ish pm) but there was no one except the security guard again. So I tried to talk with him using google translate. After he understood my intention, he was so nice that he went out to another staff’s house for asking help. That staff, who was mainly responsible for maintenance/repair, was already done for his day and I believe he lives close by the hotel since they both came back within 5 mins) He was able to give me extra towels I needed . Sadly, I still didn’t get enough towels again for day 5. I didn’t want to bother asking for help again. Every time that I found out the missing towels was already in the evening and the poor security guard couldn’t help much besides asking another staff for help. Also it wasn’t his fault. I think it is some thing that the cleaning staffs should be aware of - attention to the detail. 

The pool itself doesn’t look that clean, there were debris (like plants, bugs, etc.).  I saw the staffs sprinkled chlorine powder in the pool once. The water was not so clear which could be told by the water color. It feels like the pool needs a few maintenance - water refresh , fixing the missing or cracked tiles on the pool. In certain part of the pool, you may be able to smell strong paint smell, which I believe (just my assumption) that the room’s floor may be painted every time a guest is checked out from a room since the floor of my room had 0 scratches  on day 1 but as long as someone opened the patio door, the door will definitely scratch easily the floor.

Some reviews mentioned that the bathroom smelled like sewage. It was unpleasant, I tried to avoid it propagating out of the bathroom by closing the toilet lid and close the shower door accordingly. 

Hot water in shower will run out after 2 people took shower in a row ( max 10 mins) but it will come back after waiting like 10-15 mins, so plan the time accordingly. Good thing is in the middle of the summer so i didn’t mind to take cold shower. 

I would like to give a good review, among all the points I brought up above I could handle them, not a big deal… However, the only one thing that was unbearable was bug. The room itself has a lot of tiny bugs (grain of sand sized, looks like ant but not sure) crawling everywhere ( on the kitchen counter, floor, behind the couch, closet, coffee table etc.) l completely understood  that the weather was hot and having bugs was unavoidable, but the amount I saw in the room made me very uncomfortable. The patio doors and the unit door had no seal. Basically there were gaps on the top and bottom of the door could let any bugs come in. There were also a gecko and a beetle visiting the room once. I didn’t dare to touch anything or leave anything on anywhere because of those tiny little bugs. Also I prohibited anyone ate in the unit to attract more bugs to come. When I left an item on the table I had to shake violently it a lot to make sure no more bugs. When I packed my luggages, I had to empty them all and make sure I didn’t bring any bug around.

After 5 nights of stay, I decided to leave the hotel, I did not want to make a fuss. The place was cheap but I rather paid a bit more to stay in another hotel so that I could end well my vacation for the last 2 nights. I didn’t ask for a refund for the rest of 2 nights. I understand life is hard, especially after COVID happened and everyone should show sympathy. I just don’t want to make a big deal out of it because it was not the staffs’ fault. However, I would like others know what they are signing up for. Everyone has different tolerance on different things, this hotel may work for some but not others. ",Tripadvisor
Casablanca,Hotel,Beach Front Hotel - Casablanca Sayulita,Traditional Hotel,"Casablanca was a wonderful out of the way hotel right on the beach. It is not a resort. The hotel is an older, traditional style building(s) with a pool in the center of the two buildings. The suites have plenty of room for two with all the amenities to be comfortable for your stay. It is quite a walk to the main plaza but there are several restaurants close by as well as markets for groceries. The beach is right in front. Never felt crowed and all we came across were gracious and friendly. If there was any negative, the WIFI is not “high speed” but didn’t impact anything we needed.

The engineer came to repair the AC, however all he did was push the temp up and down several times and that was it.  Not exactly technical he never returned and when I asked him later on whats going on, he said it was fixed! Nothing of the sort… NO AC! 

As a Platinum Accor member, no amnesties were given not even water in the room.  I requested water several times and in the end, went to buy some myself from the shop outside.

The iron was from the 1970’s with some of the electric cords visible and deep cuts in the earth cable, had I not seen this and plugged it in, I would have had an electric shock.

The bathroom was dismal and no way this hotel can say they are a 5 star! Its really impossible.  You need to use all the towels on the floor to keep it dry because the glass is missing the rubber seal from the bottom, so all the water seeps out, this was present in all the rooms.

The service is absolutely zero, breakfast is a waste of money.  The valet could not find the car for 20 odd minutes only to tell me he parked it in another street and gave me directions to the car. 

I moved hotels to the Marriot Courtyard, absolutely spot on! No issues and they went above and beyond to accommodate me, even I am not a Bonvoy member but for sure shall be!

I am expecting some form of lame excuse from the hotel, as after I checked out they wanted to resolve the issue! A little too late! You lost a customer, not that you care.  For sure I shall take this up with Accor as the hotel falls far beyond the expectations, even the Ibis has better rooms and better service.",Tripadvisor

Casablanca,Restaurant,Casablanca Restaurant,An F&B let down,"I actually went here for dinner and then breakfast.

Nice ambience and setting indoors. Aircon was quiet and the right temperature.

Waitresses were attentive and confident in their tasks.

There was a specials blackboard and i selected the Tomahawk pork chop. Presented well but being quite thin it was overcooked and dry. 

For breakfast I had the English breakfast. Hmmmnnnn strange looking and stringy mushrooms that were yuk. Serioulsy a hungarian sausage on an English breakfast. 

The wine cellar boasts a big selection of European wines. Despite a chalk board sign saying Sauvingon Blanc there wasn't a drop in the hose. Now European wine doesn't cut it for me. The beer was nowhere cold enough as it's from a refrigerator. It's opened constantly and the beer should be on ice.

Now the owner is Austrian so that may explain the wine choice and Eurpean sausage for breakfast. But really it's not rocket science to make a plain sausage. 

I'm afraid the foundation of the business being foood and beverage is letting this place down.",Tripadvisor

Casablanca,Restaurant,Casablanca Restaurant,Good or bad depending on whose working,"The good news is the selection and quality of the food is generally top-notch. It's one of the few restaurants where you can get a real U.S. ribeye steak.
The bad news the quality of service is hit or miss. It depends on who's working the tables on that particular day. There's no consistency in service. One day it's outstanding the next day you basically have to chase down the staff to get anything done. Staff is present but they seem to be there just for a paycheck, too busy talking to the security guard or they are glued to their cell phone.
To add insult to injury the restaurant charges a minimum of 20 pesos for each leftover bag/container you want to bring with you. Talking about “nickel diming” and squeezing every paso they can out of a customer. Believe me, there are much better restaurants within walking distance where the quality of service is better and consistent. Plus you don't feel squeezed for every Paso in your pocket.",Tripadvisor
Casablanca,Restaurant,Casablanca Restaurant,Amazing Tuna starter,I spend time at the restaurant between my flight and ferry. I had the seared tuna starter with pepper and sesame which was AMAZING.

Casablanca,Restaurant,Casablanca Restaurant,"Waste of time, different owners",This was a really good place until it was sold to a Filipino owner. As is standard in the PH the new owners have not followed the original owners excellence. Food is a Filipino version and is sub standard.

Casablanca,Restaurant,Macerado,I'm not convinced,"I'd been there years ago and I didn't like it. I went again and again I didn't like it.

Entrance to the restaurant without car or wheelchair access. Then, we asked if they could heat some noodles for my girls (somewhat tricky) and the answer was no, they only did it with the strains...

Regarding meals I stand out in the negative: 

- Mix of oysters and clams to the Pacific, came cold seafood, cheese idem and commenting on the problem we respond that it was normal because they were frozen...
Chardonnay sour without flavor, more like a lemonade, even requesting correction.
Unflavored grilled steak, with only a cherry tomato.

The rest of the dishes ordered were good: Rabbit, pea cream, tasty but cold tomahawk.

Nice and cozy place. Well presented dishes.

Fes,Hotel,Hotel Riu Santa Fe,Been here 8 times since 2009 and will return again. Two week stay this time and could have stayed longer,"View from this resort is spectacular. The view of the mountains that make this lands end are quite a site from the beach area. This resort is within walking distance (for most) of Cabo San Lucas marina which has numerous restaurants and shops for all budgets. The boats in the Marina are a sight in themselves, Nice to see how the other half live and boy are they living. Cabo Wabo is a great evening spot for those they like the night life - very enthusiastic vibe here, music is great and dancing is good exercise.

I have stayed at the Riu Sante Fe numerous times and have never been disappointed. Cleanliness is a definite 10 out of 10. Staff were all very pleasant - I have to mention Conny from the beachside restaurant - she made our morning breakfast such a pleasure each day. She eventually learned my friends name was Gaz.

We requested a room in building 7 and they were able to accommodate us during check in. As I get older I appreciate the elevator in building 7 more and more. We had a beautiful view of the peninsula. Room was clean, bed was amazingly comfortable - everything about the room was perfect. Water and drinks refreshed every day. Room is modern and fresh looking.

There are vendors on the beach selling various wares but they are not aggressive nor in your space, and their negotiated prices are fair.

The food in the buffet was all very good but for the first time I found it a bit limited in choice - I may be getting fussier as I age. Always found something to eat and always enjoyed our meals. Line ups at some of the stations for breakfast require a bit of patience - have your coffee first and relax - you're on vacation time.

This resort is geared towards a part atmosphere and it attracts a large number of late teen, early 20's. I am over 70 and I still love the vibe of the Riu Sante Fe. The kids were all respectful and there was no issue at all with noise for us. The younger crowd helps one feel more alive so don't be scared off when they say it is a party resort. Live a little, you won't be disappointed.

In 2024 I stayed at the Riu Sante Fe in March which is whale watching season. I have done that tour twice and seeing the whales is an amazing experience. I included a couple of pictures of the whales as well

Probably missed some stuff but everything about this trip was a positive so anything I missed would just be more incentive to come to the Sante Fe.",Tripadvisor

Now the staff, friendly question must teach them I think they don't give a shit we call them they pretend not to hear, to ask to clean a table they dodge to order a coffee they take 30 minutes to bring back, not smiling not kind. Staff training needs to be completely reviewed. Not a single person DE gentile it’s sad they face the face when they serve we ask them one thing it looks like it makes them yech clearly.

Fes,Hotel,Disney Hotel Santa Fe,Basic rooms in a drab resort but convenient for parks,"The rooms are basic and dated, there are shower gel and paper cups in the room but not much else. They are clean and contain a (very dated) security safe. We had a bath and shower. The window barely opens and there is a ceiling fan, which was adequate enough to cool the room but we expected AC for the price paid. The breakfast was basic (cheap sausages, bread, juices etc), long queues if you go from about 08:00 onwards. There are no coffee/tea facilities in the room but you can get one cup per day from a vending machine located in a couple of the blocks (not great quality). There is a small gift shop and starbucks at the hotel. It took us about 20 mins to walk to the park, we never used the shuttle bus. The hotel just feels drab and no real Disney magic here, such a shame it's not been updated. If you see it as it is (a reasonable distance from the parks and a comfy bed) then it'll do!",Tripadvisor

Finally, when we DEparted, we inspected DE's rooms to be sure we had not forgotten anything and what was our surprise to see under the children's bunk beds: 2 empty bottles of water that did not belong to us! It's not normal, at the price of the stay, we expect the cleaning to be done properly, it disgusted us... we will never come back to their hotel.

Room in block 47, top floor quiet as requested near the river. Room clean & tidy, yes it requires an upgrade if you look hard for fault. Bedding all good, window did open & fan was sufficient for the outside temperature. Bathroom toiletries required to be filled & bath could have been cleaned better.

Fes,Hotel,Piñon Court By La Fonda,Great downtown location and experience,"This is a prime downtown location. The complimentary Breakfast was very satisfying with many options available. I enjoyed the happy hour specials on my first day. The property does not have a gym or pool on site, so I enjoyed walking for my daily exercise. The staff were very helpful and provide a map explaining how to walk around to various areas of interest. I felt safe walking in the area as the location was waking distance of many downtown areas of interests, including the Loretta chapel, the Rail Yard, and Canyon Road. After reading many reviews, I rented an suv to get around but only used it for other attractions not located in the downtown area. My room had a microwave and mini refrigerator that I put to use. I never used the tv. My only slight drawback was the sound that carried from other rooms. I could hear conversations in my bathroom and front door from nearby guest rooms. (My room was in the first floor in the corner.) It didn’t prevent me from sleeping but was a bit annoying. I’m glad no one had extended nocturnal activities. 😉 Overall I would recommend staying at this location, but I would choose another that has a pool and gym onsite for convenience. If this were not an important factor for me, I would return.",Tripadvisor

Fes,Hotel,Piñon Court By La Fonda,"Lacks Customer Care; Beautiful Hotel, great location!","There is something seriously wrong with the reservation side of this hotel. I made a reservation a week or two ago, and then couldn't find any confirmation so thought I must have been mistaken. So I made another reservation. After not receiving any confirmation after waiting an hour or two, I called the hotel. That's when I learned that I now had two identical reservations, so I asked them to cancel the most expensive one and send me a confirmation for the existing one. The confirmation consisted of a one paragraph statement of the dates with no mention of the rate. So I decided to cancel my reservation since by now I had Zero trust in the management. The website had an option to manage my reservation online so I tried to do that, but was foiled by the confirmation number that they sent me for the second reservation not being recognized by the system! So I called yet again to cancel and asked for a confirmation of my cancellation. They gave me number over the phone, but again never received a written confirmation. I will NEVER consider this hotel again and caution other possible clients to be very careful about proof of their reservations or cancellations.",Tripadvisor

I would stay here again but I'd be prepared in knowing that this is a ""do it yourself"" experience.

We needed help in getting walking directions and getting the lay of the land but each time we went to the front desk, the young lady was always on the phone. Even when the toilet was overflowing in the front lobby, I finally had to interrupt her on her call, to let her know, there was an issue. There was no ""thank you for letting her know"" or acknowledgment that I even existed. She totally lacked any interest in being helpful or friendly. Same with the night time person; didn't offer getting someone to help us, as we climbed deep stairs with heavy bags to our rooms. We had to point to brochures on the front desk and ask ""are these maps?"" with one word replies ""yes"" Again lovely place to stay just be prepared to not bother the staff. LOL.",Tripadvisor

Fes,Hotel,Four Seasons Resort Rancho Encantado Santa Fe,Beautiful facilities and great staff,"We went for two nights on a girls trip and booked on Amex, over 3 k for two nights. The room is nice but the hotel is nothing special.  The worst part was the service. The hotel told us we have $100 credit and $70 per breakfast which we used. When we left the hotel told us that the credit did not apply as we didn't put incidentals on Amex and gave them a visa instead. They charged us an extra $270. When we called and said that we were never told that we need to give Amex for incidental (which we happly would have) the manager hung up on us! This is the worst experience at 4 seasons we ever had and that manager needs to get dismissed! He wouldn't give us the contact of his manager!

It took another hours to get our food (and we couldn't find a waiter to order more wine).  The bergers were tepid and VERY WELL DONE.  The buns were soggy on the bottom, dry non the top.  The onion rings were tepid and greasy.  The waiter apologized when delivering the food, and offered to comp the wine.  The bill, still $100, took another 30  minutes as the waiter had now disappeared.  We finally went to the reception desk to pay.

Fes,Hotel,Four Seasons Resort Rancho Encantado Santa Fe,There is currently a large scale construction project going on.,"I stayed at the Four Seasons Santa Fe for an early Christmas trip with my partner and his parents, and we had an absolutely lovely time. This property definitely lives up to the Four Seasons name, and was a really relaxing and beautiful place to unwind for a few days in the high desert of New Mexico. The sunsets from the bar's terrace are breathtaking. The resort is a short drive (about 15-20 minutes) to downtown Santa Fe, and its about a 45 minute drive to Bandelier National Monument which was surprisingly cool as a self-guided day trip.

My partner and I stayed in a Rancho Suite, which was AMAZING, and my parents-in-law stayed in a Vista Casita. All of the rooms are recently renovated, and feel fresh, and have a modern, chic, and sophisticated style with a distinctly New Mexican touch. The Rancho Suite was incredibly spacious - huge, really - with a large living room, large bedroom, gigantic full bathroom / dressing area, and a separate powder room. And the signature Four Seasons mattress and bedding - honestly its my favorite part of staying at a Four Seasons! The Suite also had a large outdoor patio, and two fireplaces, one indoor and outdoor. I would highly recommend upgrading to the Suite, if possible to feel like you're really treating yourself. The Vista Casita, which my parents-in-law stayed in, was also incredibly tasteful and thoughtful in its interior design and furnishings - but I was just blown away by the suite! The difference between the Rancho Suite and Encantado Suite is apparently the view, with the Encantado Suite having one, and the Rancho Suite not. The view from the Rancho Suite was terrestrial, not too bad, with desert landscaping and such. It is worth calling and speaking to someone at the resort after booking if you are particular about your view - I was surprised to see the resort's layout after arriving, which isn't easy to understand from the online photos - some of the casitas look like they have views more directly onto the parking area, or are nearer to other casitas - while other casitas look like they are naturally positioned to be facing a more private direction. 

Two other great, and complementary, amenities of the resort are - you can reserve a private hot tub area via the spa - which we took advantage of each day - this might be harder to reserve when the resort is busy. And, there is a really scenic hiking trail that starts right from the resort, and has great views of the surrounding landscape, local plants, and wasn't too challenging for a novice (it had some steep bits, so at times a workout!) But, it was nice to do a hike without having to drive to a trailhead.

The service was superb, with all of the team being friendly, and making us feel welcome. Each night we had the ""fire butler"" come and light our fireplaces. The hotel also provides complementary s'more kits / marshmallow roasting kits, which was a really cute touch. The staff in the main lobby area were always kind and friendly, asking if we needed anything to help with our stay. The bar and restaurant staff were amazing, and were so friendly, remembering us day-to-day during our stay, etc. When we were greeted at arrival, one of the guest services managers met us personally, offered us sparkling wine, and after speaking with my mother-in-law about her interest in stargazing, offered to arrange a stargazing session with a local professor (which she did, and my mother-in-law loved it, but I have to note, we weren't told a price when reserving, and we didn't find it listed in the activity guide, and on our bill I saw that we were billed nearly $300. So, that was a bit of a surprise!). One thing we found hit or miss was the housekeeping service, especially in comparison with other Four Seasons hotels and resorts we've stayed at - during our four nights, a couple of the days the room cleaning and servicing was fine; but a couple days it felt lackluster or perhaps rushed - blankets not refolded and put away, outdoor furniture left a mess, living room furniture not resituated - just nothing ""special"" like at other Four Seasons' housekeeping where you get back to your room and think ""oh how lovely!"" or ""what a lovely touch"" or ""I can't believe they even tidied my charging cables!"". This is a small complaint and of course, the rooms were always clean, beds made, etc - you just expect a little bit ""extra"" touch with daily housekeeping or turndown when you're in this level of luxury hotel.

And last, a note on the restaurant and bar - the food and beverage is truly delicious at both - but it's worth noting, the prices, especially at the restaurant are sky high, which did make me question the price/value proposition of the restaurant and bar. For example, my father-in-law ordered a martini at dinner, and it cost $38. It wasn't uncommon for cocktails to be priced over $30 on the menu. Breakfast for two each morning easily cost my partner and me $100. That felt exorbitant - this isn't London or Paris, it's New Mexico... The food and beverage is priced higher than the Four Seasons Lanai in Hawaii for crying out loud lol! And unlike other Four Seasons, this resort didn't a offer more ""casual"" grab-and-go or cafe-style option that's more reasonably priced when you're not looking for fine dining. Even the bar menu was really pricey for what it was. That being said, there is a ""happy hour"" with a few ""affordable"" items to snack and drink on as you're watching the sunset, but just - well, be prepared to spend a lot on food and drink if you stay on property! And, you'll want to stay on property because it's so lovely!

Overall, we really enjoyed our time staying at Rancho Encantado - and would highly recommend it to someone looking for a luxury stay in the Santa Fe area. Despite a few small quibbles, it surpassed my expectations in almost every way!",Tripadvisor
Fes,Hotel,Four Seasons Resort Rancho Encantado Santa Fe,Luxury in the Land of Enchantment,"Be advised. There is currently a large scale expansion project going on.  The noise and pounding is unbearable and permeates throughout the entire building.  If you are looking for peace and quiet, this is NOT the place. Also the service level is about the same as the Holiday Inn, in other words, it is terrible. It takes 10 requests to get some ice sent to your room. This is the absolute WORST Four Seasons I have ever stayed at. Maybe the last.",Tripadvisor
Fes,Hotel,Four Seasons Resort Rancho Encantado Santa Fe,,"We stayed for a glorious four nights last month, loved it and can't wait to return. The casitas are lovely, comfortable and spacious, and the whole property feels like it fits in perfectly in the desert setting, as Four Seasons often do. We had breakfast at Terra every morning and food and service were always excellent, with a special mention for Estrella for providing wonderful and warm service to start our day. The food was also fantastic, and I am still dreaming of those blue corn pancakes. We had a wonderful and quiet dinner there one evening as well, where food wine and service again were exceptional. We used the hotel shuttle just about every day to drive us into town near the plaza or Canyon Road, and enjoyed chatting with Elijah and the rest of the drivers. We visited the spa every afternoon and loved the private courtyard sauna and hot tub, it was a great way to wind down before dinner; to sit in the courtyard under the sun and listen to the birds chirping. Overall, we can't say enough good things about it and look forward to coming back.",Tripadvisor
Fes,Hotel,"La Posada de Santa Fe, a Tribute Portfolio Resort & Spa",An embarrassment for Santa Fe,"This used to be a nice hotel. No more.

I’ll start by saying that I live in Santa Fe (30+ years). I was also in the hotel business for many years here. I understand historic old buildings and know they can be charming & challenging. But this hotel is an embarrassment.

I had to book a room last minute. I had to appear for a legal matter on a Zoom call and my Internet and phone both went out just hours before I was due to appear. My attorney called to make a reservation for me & explained I only needed the room for a few hours and really only needed a phone and internet. He was told to book online. He called back to let them know I was coming. I checked in at 1:45 for my 2:00 meeting. When I questioned the rate, I was told by the front desk manager that I should have booked the day rate. We would have if they would have taken our reservation when we first called. The front desk manager was rather unpleasant and refused to change the rate. Ok-I get it. But I expected the room to at least be adequate for a four diamond hotel.

The room was awful. Dark and drab, no adequate lighting. The hallway to my room was filthy with leaves and debris on the floor. The carpet in the halls and in my room were filthy. The bathroom wall was streaked with something disgusting next to the toilet. The furnishings were dated, dreary. The room was so smoky that I had to open all the windows to get decent air. The screen fell off. Both the sink and the tub were dripping water (we are very water conscious in the high desert). The light in the bathroom was broken. The windows were dirty. The air conditioner was so loud that needed to turn it off for my call but the room was so dark, I couldn’t find the thermostat.

I checked out after my zoom call at about 7:00pm. I asked the valet to please pull my car up to the front since I am disabled. I tipped him well to bring my car. Although there were no other cars there at the time, he left my car parked at the bottom of the hill with the keys on the visor. I asked the front desk to please check me out. They said it was “all taken care of.” I asked for a copy of my charges. The girl went into the back and I waited and waited. When no one came back, I left. No one asked me about my stay or let me know what was happening. There was no one in the lobby or at the front desk. My clothes and hair reeked of smoke.

So about five hours of bad service and a really dirty dark smoke filled room for the low low price of $556.00.

As a Santa Fean who lives less than 2 miles from La Posada, I take great pride in my community. There are many lovely hotels in downtown Santa Fe but this hotel is truly awful. I hope management will take notice and realize that this hotel is in desperate need of renovation and proper maintenance and the staff needs training to represent what you claim to be a luxury property. Only the location gives this hotel anything noteworthy.",Tripadvisor

Fes,Hotel,"La Posada de Santa Fe, a Tribute Portfolio Resort & Spa",Stay somewhere else,"Got in just after midday. Room was ready. That was a good sign, but the last one. Room had a fireplace and reeked of smoke. Somewhere outside/above the room there was a beeping noise about every minute, 24/7. The topper was a dirty rag hanging on the shower curtain rod. Went to the front desk. They said they would take care of all three. They replaced air filter in room. A little better with the smoke smell, but still not great. Maintenance came and somehow could not figure out how to stop the beeping. They had no solution for the noise, not even a new room available. I hardly slept all week. The dirty rag? I waited three days to see if they would take care of it. It stayed there until I knocked it on the floor (with a hangar), then it disappeared.

The pool was dirty, and we would not go in.

All in all a complete dud.",Tripadvisor

Walking distance to the Santa Fe plaza. Our go-to place when visiting the city. Our room was not ready when we arrived, so we just drove around to reorient ourselves with the areas around the plaza. Received a call when our room was ready and we returned to the hotel to unload our luggage and check in. Valet parking was great, employees great, but perhaps a few more are needed. When I called for my car, the phone was only answered on one day, resulting in a lengthier time to have our car brought around for our use. Room 212 was large and excellent. Our only challenge were the sky lights (2) which poured light into the room at sunrise. In the future, we will ask for a room without skylights. We ate breakfast at the hotel restaurant daily. Axel on the staff was excellent. He was attentive, professional, and helpful. Front desk staff was great. We also participated in the evening tastings in the lounge, which were excellent and informative. The bar staff were friendly as well. The colorful landscaping helps create a great, serene atmosphere. Overall, a great experience.",Tripadvisor
Fes,Hotel,"La Posada de Santa Fe, a Tribute Portfolio Resort & Spa",Nice atmosphere but needs an update!,"The location is perfect, within walking distance of the downtown area and restaurants. The original home turned into lobby is beautiful and the bar and restaurant areas are quaint. Our room was upgraded to a fireplace room, which unfortunately smelled like a campfire. The floor was not level so the head of our bed was actually lower than the foot of the bed. We weren’t offended by this because the hotel appeared old and historic so this just added to it. However, the bathroom had no room to store much and it was in need of a very good overall cleaning. The sink, toilet, and shower were surface-clean, but the dust around the floors around sink and throughout as well as the marred paint made you question cleanliness in general. The worst was that our “upgraded” room made all of our clothes smell like a campfire. When we unpacked clothing at our next hotel, our clothes wreaked. The rooms of this hotel really need an upgrade. We’ve stayed in other hotels with fireplaces and have never experienced this before. Our room also ran very warm even with a/c cranked down. We used points for this room. We would have been extremely disappointed if we paid the going rate. It’s still tough as a Platinum member to experience this and have used our hard-earned points for a subpar experience.",Tripadvisor
Fes,Hotel,"La Posada de Santa Fe, a Tribute Portfolio Resort & Spa","Outside awesome, room not so much","A really cool but old house serves as the lobby, bar and some of the restaurant. The grounds are really pretty and well taken care of. All positive points on the outside. Oh, and the location is perfect and within walking distance to everything downtown.

Our room (and assuming the others) are in desperate need of updating; something I seem to be saying a lot lately in my reviews. We had an adobe fireplace in our room, and while it was cool to see, it smelled like an old campfire. The furniture is really old, the carpet and bench stained, old tub/curtain setup for the shower like a low level motel. And it was not cleaned very well at all. The only positive about the room itself is the bed was comfortable as most Marriott beds are.

We used our points to book this hotel and I'm betting there are better Marriott or hilton properties near by. La Posada is a historical place, but the rooms need some TLC.",Tripadvisor
Fes,Hotel,"La Posada de Santa Fe, a Tribute Portfolio Resort & Spa",Great location and outdoor areas,"The location and the patio restaurant are the highlights of this hotel. The location is excellent - two or three blocks from the plaza, as well as about three blocks from the beginning of Canyon Road and its art galleries. While there are some hotels closer to the plaza, they would be a longer walk from Canyon Road. I’m in my late 60s, and easily walked from the hotel to the main stretch of the Canyon Road galleries (and back). The outdoor patio was a delightful setting for both dinner and breakfast. Marriott elites should be aware that the free breakfast for Bonvoy platinum and above offers only a limited choice of 4 or 5 items, and does not include the tip. I passed on that, and ordered the fruit plate for breakfast, which was very nice and quite large - one of the best fruit plates I’ve had. I booked a Sage room (over the spa) to be sure I would have access to an elevator, since other rooms are either ground floor (where people walk past your windows) or require climbing steps. My room had a small balcony that overlooked a rooftop- other rooms on this level had larger balconies with apparently nicer views. There is a nice open air sitting area one floor above this level, which apparently few people notice. The hotel grounds are pretty and atmospheric, and help make up for rooms that could definitely use a refresh. My room was a decent size, but rather dark, and the furnishings needed updating. The hotel offers an on-demand shuttle service to Museum Hill or certain other areas (I think they said within 2 miles) but I did not use it.",Tripadvisor

3. Heard my neighbors when they talked, sneezed, coughed, etc.
4. Room was dark. Couldn’t keep the window shade open since people walked by and could look in.
5. Staff not friendly.
6. Pool area was gross. People left their plates, drinks, towels and it was not cleaned up timely by the staff.
7. Our unit had one shared outdoor table for 3 rooms. Other rooms had much more ample outdoor seating.
8. No water in the room. Hotels usually leave 2 bottles of water in the room.
9. TV was not on a bracket that rotated. So we couldn’t watch it in bed.

Brother had eggs ranchero. Best he had ever had he said. Great food and service. My wife and I have been going here for many years. Love the place.,Tripadvisor
Fes,Restaurant,Cafe Pasqual's,Just okay,"Cute little spot on the corner with an obvious line of people waiting around on the sidewalk. We made our way to the desk and were told it would be 15-20 minutes. The cool thing is you don't have to wait around because they will both call and text you when the table is ready. We shopped a bit and they were true to their word in terms of timing. 

We were able to sit in a booth and noticed that a large round table in the middle of the room is a communal table, so be prepared to sit with strangers if you're a small party. It's very packed and staff are busy, busy, busy.

The person who took our drink orders and got us settled also told us what the special of the day was. They were friendly and engaging, answering a few questions we already had.

The person who took our order wasn't the easiest to understand nor were we easy for them to understand so it took some work to figure it all out. When the food arrived, it looked good and ended up being just okay. Two of the people in our group said they wouldn't order the breakfast burrito again because it was just ""meh."" My dish (think breakfast nachos) was too heavy on the onions and not enough of other items. It wasn't as special as I wanted it to be.

Anyway, for three of us the bill was just over $100 with tip, so that should give you an idea on cost. Cafe Pasqual's was recommended to us and we're glad we gave it a try but probably won't return.",Tripadvisor

Fes,Restaurant,Cafe Pasqual's,Festive corner eatery,They don't take reservations for breakast and worried about the wait.  We arrived at 8:30am and were seated right way.  The service was fast and when we left half-hour later there was a short line out the door.  Service everywhere is super fast; not even enough time to drink your coffee.  I had avocado toast -- it even came with bacon.  It was very good and a nice change from traditional Mexican breakfast.,Tripadvisor
Fes,Restaurant,Cafe Pasqual's,Michelin-star worthy!,"We've eaten in restaurants around the world, including Michelin-starred extravaganzas.  The truth is, however, that this smallish family-run restaurant is at least as good as any of them.  The food is always freshly made.  I had the bison burger today.  I asked for it medium, and it was spot on when delivered.  The menu description tells you that it is topped with green chiles.  In virtually every restaurant I have been in, this means that they are chopped from a can.  Here, they were whole chiles that had been cooked to perfection.  The gruyere topper was superb, as were the lightly grilled red onion (cooked enough to remove the snap, but not drooping).  I had it with the salad side and with the real-deal blue cheese dressing.  When I come away from here, my wife and I always comment that it is just a better meal than anywhere else in town.",Tripadvisor

My friends and I enjoyed browsing the nearby shops while we waited for the text telling us our table was ready. Once seated at the community table, I enjoyed the best mimosa with fresh-squeezed orange juice and split a yummy breakfast burrito stuffed with chorizo and hash browns. And the green chilies had quite the kick I was looking for -- go Hatch, lol. Breakfast was hot, plentiful --  and good for splitting or leftovers later. The staff was really friendly and attentive. We thoroughly enjoyed everything -- the food, the wall murals, the atmosphere!",Tripadvisor
Fes,Restaurant,Cafe Pasqual's,TERRIBLE CAFE for TOURISTS!,"I'm sorry to break the 5-star reviews. How can you pay $128.00 for four breakfasts consisting of tortillas, eggs, beans, and bacon? The food is overpriced, the place is very small, and there's no room at the tables. One of the servers was very rude and unprofessional. We were lucky to find a New Yorker named Julie, and she sorted things out for us. We were visiting from New Jersey and are planning another trip next year to Santa Fe. This cafe will definitely not be on our list of places to eat. My advice to the owner: Please train your employees and teach them some human relations.",Tripadvisor

Fes,Restaurant,Geronimo,A Santa Fe Treasure—Consistently Exceptional,"This review is long overdue and still won’t fully capture the magic that is Geronimo. It’s a true gem—one of the best restaurants in the country, tucked into the heart of Santa Fe. I’ve been lucky enough to dine here dozens of times over the years, and every single experience has been outstanding.

From the warm welcome at the door to the attentive (but never overbearing) service, Geronimo nails the details. The atmosphere is elegant yet relaxed, full but never crowded, and perfect for a memorable evening.

On my most recent visit, we started with a special tomato and burrata appetizer—fresh, vibrant, and delicious—and the best beef tartare I’ve ever had. For entrées, our table ordered the signature elk (a must-try), the sweet and spicy prawns, and the short ribs, which were tender and rich. We ended with the apple dessert (almost too beautiful to eat) and the crepe, which was the table favorite. Even the coffee service impressed, arriving with warm scones that were the perfect finishing touch.

Geronimo was the highlight of our girls' weekend and never fails to deliver. If you’re in Santa Fe, this spot should be at the top of your list.",Tripadvisor
Fes,Restaurant,Geronimo,Best Meal We Had in Santa Fe,We had dinner here for Mother's Day and it was fabulous. Very high touch from the moment we gave our car to the valet. We were greeted warmly and shown to a lovely table. My husband enjoyed one of their specialty cocktails and I had a glass of wine. My husband had the lobster bisque and said it was amazing! I had the Alaskan halibut for my main course and my husband had the rack of lamb which arrived at the table with a presentation that could not be ignored.  I had a flourless chocolate cake for dessert and my husband had an assortment of sorbets with a cappuccino. This was the best meal we had while in Santa Fe and created an unforgettable dining experience.,Tripadvisor
Fes,Restaurant,Geronimo,Overpriced and mediocre,"After reading such high reviews we were really looking forward to dining here, but it was such a disappointment.  The seating was cramped, the service mediocre, and food just ok.  I ordered their elk signature dish, which was tasty but cold and hard to cut.  The side of sautéed spinach was floating in water.  My husband ordered their  special, beef Wellington, which was way undercooked and tasteless.  For the high price, we expected much more.",Tripadvisor
Fes,Restaurant,Geronimo,A must restaurant when in Santa Fe,"The Wagyu Carpaccio and the Ahi Tuna Sashimi and Tartare appetizers were excellent.

Fes,Restaurant,Geronimo,Excellent dining experience at Geronimo in Santa Fe!,"Geronimo is a wonderful restaurant, and has been a top-rated place in Santa Fe for decades now.  My wife and I dined here every year for several years in a row but hadn't been back in 17 years, since our kids arrived on the scene, and we missed it.  The restaurant was even better than we'd remembered.  It's a great place for a celebratory dinner or a special night out, but not stuffy -- our 14-year-old and 17-year-old both greatly enjoyed our dinner.  My son and I both enjoyed the elk, which was exceptional, and I'd also recommend the Wasabi Caesar Salad.  Geronimo also features an excellent, and carefully curated, wine list, so you're sure to find something to pair with your dinner.  Definitely reserve a table (and an evening) to enjoy Geronimo during your next visit to Santa Fe!",Tripadvisor
Fes,Restaurant,Geronimo,Mixed Review,"As on our previous occasion, service was very good. Had pear salad and the Caesar salad. Both were very good. Request for anchovies was met, making the Caesar even better for me. Wine (bottle) was a very good Barbera d’Alba albeit a little pricey. I chose the elk steak (waitress said it was their #1 entree); it was a little tough and I would not order again as the bacon in the gravy overwhelmed the elk flavor. Spouse had the filet. Sauce was good, but the steak, while tender, offered a non-descriptive flavor. We were seated at a table in the bar; would not do again, as we got a non-stop listen in on the bartender’s non-stop interaction and stories with a couple seated at the bar. This made the table a noisy choice. Given the above, and a pricey $300+ tab ($110 for the wine), we did not find this visit as enjoyable as last years visit. Not sure we’d go this route again, although, obviously, this is a very high end Santa Fe restaurant.",Tripadvisor

Tanger,Hotel,Hilton Garden Inn Tanger City Center,Not worth the price you have to pay,"Very disappointed with my stay at the Hilton garden hinn hotel in Tangier. One day, on returning after a long day, the room was still not ready until 7pm. — an unacceptable situation for a hotel in this category.

Moreover, the floor of the room was never cleaned once because my daughter had dropped coca all week. For an establishment with such high rates, a minimum of rigour and comfort is expected, which clearly has not been the case.

The only positive: the staff, really nice and professional. But despite their kindness, this is not enough to compensate for the lack of overall quality of service. the hotel is clearly not worth its price. I strongly believe that there is a lack of training at staff level.

The hotel experience was excellent—the hospitality was spot on, and the staff were exceptional, especially **Fathine** and her colleague at reception (whose name I unfortunately can’t recall). They went out of their way to arrange a late check-out for me, making my stay even more comfortable.  

However, the **Royal Spa**, which is linked to the hotel, was a disappointment. While it may not be directly managed or owned bythe hotel, the owner's daughter of the spa personally promised us a one-hour massage**, yet we received **only 45 minutes**—despite the high price. The service and overall experience at the spa were poor. The ladies working there were professional and hardworking, but it was evident they were treated unfairly—expected to work long hours without proper compensation.

The room was lovely and had a bath, though shower blew hot and cold. The hotel seemed to cater more for business travellers, and during our stay a conference there made the breakfast area completely over subscribed. 4 sunbeds around the pool and not a very welcoming area as had been shut up for winter including the pool bar. The spa and indoor pool were cost extras, including the equivalent of 20 euros per hour to use the indoor pool. Without this spa I'm not sure how the hotel earns it's star rating.

Their solution was to invite me to book again with a 50 euros a night higher rate: 150 euros intead of 92euros.

Tanger,Hotel,Occidental Tanger,OK hotel definitely not 5 stars,"I’m not sure how this hotel was rated so highly. We arrived in our room only to find that there were no bath towels, only hand towels. We called down but there was no answer at reception (it was late, around 10:00 pm) and no number for housekeeping. In the morning, we stopped by reception on our way to breakfast and requested the towels. When we went back to our room that evening, still no towels. We stopped the housekeeping attendant and she brought us the towels.
The breakfast buffet, the were people using their hands to grab the food because there weren’t enough serving utensils for each platter.
All in all, I would say this is really no more than a 3 star hotel. It is fine for that rating and about what you would expect. The bed was comfortable and the room was clean.

It is located in the residential area of the medina and within walking distance to the main attractions. The rooms have everything you need and are comfortable, but in my opinion they are a bit 'suffocated' since they do not have windows towards the outside, only towards the inside patio and that could make you feel a bit exposed. Also, there is no lift, so you have to use the stairs but it is only 4 stories tall.

It was beautiful, clean and spacious with many nice amenities. Both the breakfasts and dinners were delicious and beautifully presented and served by quiet and attentive staff.  Eating on the rooftop terrace with a wonderful view was an added bonus.  All of the staff was friendly and attentive to our needs but Noura, the manager was outstanding.  She had many communications with me before our arrival and made herself available at all times during our stay.  She was very professional and helpful, arranging for transportation on arrival and departure, recommending restaurants and authentic shopping as well as arranging guided tours of Tangier and Asilah.  The tour guide she booked for us, Hamza was very knowledgeable and friendly and accommodated our schedule and all requests including assisting us with providing food for some of the homeless animals in the city and arranging for a camel ride on the beach. In addition, Noura acted as our liason with a tour company we had reserved before arriving.  Her assistance was invaluable. We all loved our stay in Dar Chams Tanja and would highly recommend it.   If we go back to Tangier we most definitely will stay there again.",Tripadvisor
Tanger,Hotel,Dar Chams Tanja,Charming and Elegant Hotel near the Medina,"My husband, teenage daughter and I LOVED the Dar Chams. Our rooms were  beautiful with wonderful authentic Moroccan touches. My daughter and I splurged on the hammam located right at the hotel and followed it with a massage. WOW!! It was a great experience. The breakfasts on the rooftop were wonderful as was the dinner there - we were even able to get a bottle of wine. Nora was always helpful and a wonderful hostess. We highly recommend the Dar Chams. It was a terrific beginning to our Moroccan adventure. Thank you Dar Chams for your wonderful hospitality.",Tripadvisor

Tanger,Hotel,Mnar Castle,Excellent aparthotel in Tangier,"Residence in formula Aparthotel. We had taken a 2 bedroom apartment on the 2nd floor. The accommodation also has a well-equipped kitchen, a single bathroom and a terrace with sea views and a small living room with leather armchairs and a dining table and TV. The whole accommodation is air conditioned. Cleaning is done and well done. No elevator. No parking problem. the residence is 20 minutes from the center of Tangier.

Tanger,Hotel,Mnar Castle,Spacious apartment with all amenities. Noise carries from adjacent apartment. 15+ miute drive to medina.,"This is like an apartment complex with rather large apartments. The ""room"" I got was an apartment with a kitchen, two large bedrooms, a living/family and dining room and a balcony with comfortable seating. The kitchen has everything, including a cooking range and a fridge.

There is a small Bosch clothes washer as well. When you run it, it is loud, and sounds like a helicopter taking off. Although no dryer to dry the clothes. The service was awesome. The staff, mostly ladies, took my wet clothes and dried them in their large industrial drier in the morning.

Sound carries. I could hear the guests in the apartment above me, talking and moving about late in the night.

It is actually not the ideal location for a sightseeing trip to the Tangier medina since that is about 15-20 minutes away from the apartment complex.

I has a bunch of smaller quibbles but nothing to dissuade someone else from staying at these apartments. While waiting for my clothes to dry in the morning, I was able to update a very receptive lady host what all of these little quibbles were. She was very grateful and eager to address the issues I brought up.

The reasons for the 4-star rating versus a 5-star were the location being far from the medina, the noise, and the minor quibbles.",Tripadvisor
Tanger,Hotel,Mnar Castle,WARNING: Do NOT stay at this hotel. Once you were checked and they will try to blackmail you for more money. Horrifying,"I am extending a FIRM WARNING, especially to Americans traveling to Tangier. When you book they will take your money up front and right before you leave blackmail you for more money and threaten to leave bad reviews which they will do making up embarrassing accusations to try to strong arm you into giving them cash under the table. They even tried to keep us from our room the last night making us go in this office where they told us if we paid them more money they would give us access to our items. It is horrifying the practices here and I would advise that anyone considering staying here as beautiful as it is do NOT as they will try to scam you. I’ve traveled the world for years and I’ve never ever experienced anything like this. It is horrifying. What I expect as a result of this review is they will write some crazy story and then contact me via WhatsApp asking me to pay them extra money to take it down. I had to pay them to be able to get my suitcases. Please know you should definitely not get in the situation of staying with them. This experience was unreal and I can’t believe they get away with this stuff.",Tripadvisor
Tanger,Hotel,Mnar Castle,Nice if you like to stay in the middle of nowhere,"I stayed at the Mnar Castle for 6 weeks last October to November 2019. I thought it was lovely at first but after such a lengthy stay I observed some issues which would discourage me from staying there again.
First, the hotel is in the middle of nowhere. There is one single restaurant across a busy road and a dining room in the hotel. neither one serves alcohol. There IS a shuttle, but there are limitations to where it will take you, only to a couple of places and getting them to pick you up is a challenge, you must phone the hotel to make arrangements and often they are not very organized.

Secondly, the Hotel is crawling with young families. If you have three or four children yourself I guess you might appreciate that, but if you are a sophisticated couple or single you could be irritated by all the noisy families everywhere. The breakfast room, which serves a large buffet, (no sneeze glass, just buffet tables) is very nice but the young children touch all the food. Inevitably there will be screaming babies in there and some even ride scooters around the room, or race around the tables or lots of crying and shouting. If you are looking for a good nights sleep, be aware that a screaming baby might keep you up to the wee small hours.
Thirdly, No soundproofing in any of the rooms. I knew whenever any of my neighbors was using the toilet at 4 am and I knew precisely what they were doing. Yikes!
Fourthly, Do not ask the women at the front desk for suggestions on where to go in Tangier because they only know what is on the property. Horse riding, dune buggy riding and the odd bus tour. If you ask them about anything authentic they will send you to overpriced tourist spots. That's because they don't explore Tangier properly themselves. I had an episode with another Canadian couple on a trip to Chefchouen, the blue city. The girl at the desk booked us on a private car which was several times more expensive than the one we understood her to be booking us on. I paid the difference, but the other couple didn't pay and checked out early. The trip was a little spoiled for them. If you want info on what to see in Tangier, use the Internet and then ask the locals.

Fifthly. Do not under any circumstances bring valuables with you to this hotel. There are no room safes and not even a main safe where you can store passports, cash, camera equipment, jewelry or watches. I had a pair of Chanel earrings stolen by someone entering my suite, possible a chambermaid? when I was out. I did tell one of the front desk girls about it and she was horrified promising me if I could remember the day it happened, the maid would be promptly fired. But I didn't want anybody to be fired so I didn't say.

Sixthly. Although the main shuttle driver, who by the way spoke not a word of English or French, just Arabic was a pleasant and accommodating sort, the driver that filled in on his day off came on to me several times which I found disrespectful. I didn't say anything at the time because he had a wife and family to support but if you are a woman travelling alone, stay to the middle or back of the bus when he is driving.

On a more positive note, I found the young gentleman who looked after the horse riding program incredibly helpful when I had a problem with a Microsoft word program on my laptop. I cannot say anything else but thanks a million you saved the day for me.

The hotel is clean, beds are comfortable, maid service is thorough, grounds are pretty, but I believe it's better to stay near the center of the city where the action is and where you have choices. The lack of good English spoken at Mnar Castle also makes things a challenge.",Tripadvisor
Tanger,Hotel,Mnar Castle,Best option for families in Tanger,"Super welcoming staff that will do beyond what is expected to please their clients. They offered traditional Moroccan sweets upon arrival, Guzlan was calling daily to check that everything was alright, and further more they gave us a new year stylish silver plated souvenir plate! Though simple furniture, with single no shower bathroom, but the apartment was very clean, with amazing view so we cant complain. Daily house keeping service. Breakfast is more than a brunch, and almost as heavy as dinner with many traditional options, freshly squeezed juices, and hot drinks upon request. The room has no safe box, but they provided us with one immediately when we asked. We reported at the end of our stay that we didnt like the pillows as they were hard, and they responded saying they would have been happy to replace them, if we have reported that! We stayed 4 nights, and we re booked with them one more night at the end of our trip as we could be happier.",Tripadvisor
Tanger,Hotel,Mnar Castle,Great for families,"Mnar Castle represents good value for anyone traveling to Tangier who is not wedded to staying in the inner city. The hotel has a fantastic breakfast buffet, large and comfortable apartments, a large swimming pool (which we did not use) and it has a reliable shuttle that runs frequently into various locations in the city including all the areas that a tourist might want to visit. When we were there there were families from other parts of Morocco as well as China and parts of Europe staying there, and with the large apartments and great buffet it is a great value for families in particular.

It was a good and large meal especially the beef one. Ended the course with Moroccan tea and pastries. Paid 200 dirhams for a dinner for two including tip and it was worth it.

Tanger,Restaurant,Restaurant L'Ocean,"Beautiful, seaside and fresh fish","We came here by chance, and we were very happy. We highly recommend booking, otherwise you will not have a table in the outdoor terrace which is really nice and you will probably sit inside, as happened to us. The service is very slow, so if it bothers you avoid it, if you are more patient it can be the restaurant for you, they are still very courteous. We ordered gazpacho and tuna and octopus carpaccio. All very good. To continue as a main course we took the sole mugnania, really good and tasty, and the fillet of pageot royal, good. Both dishes were accompanied by pasta with pesto (I know, as Italians it is a bit strange) and cooked vegetables. Perhaps the thing a little less good were just the side dishes. In addition, in this restaurant you will also find wine, beer... which is always difficult in Morocco. The price is certainly higher than the Moroccan average, but still lower than Italian prices.",Tripadvisor
Tanger,Tourist+Attraction,Restaurant Ahlen,Wasn't impressed. I had high expectations after reading some good reviews.,"Very polite softly spoken staff, but took us an hour to get served and no, restaurant was not that busy. We did request gluten free options so I understand perhaps thats why other got served before us, but when the food did come... The quality of the traditional food besides the chips ( which were obviously freshly made in clean oil) was very poor. I ordered a seafood grill and seafood tagine. Fish was not fresh and tagine tasted off...I was too tired to complain and so we just paid and left.",Tripadvisor

Breakfast is on the rooftop terrace, which has stunning views all around.  They have a lady on site who does massage (her name escapes me, apologies!), which was very relaxing and highly recommended.  Felix and his entire team are exceptional - from the front of house welcome, to all the ladies who do breakfast, to the nightguard who looks after the place.

Essaouira,Hotel,Dar Maya,Disappointment,"I found it really embarrassing to stay in a so-called ""Riad de Charme"" which, unfortunately, charming has absolutely nothing and the photos you see on the site then live are other. From the reception to the structure, to the level of decor, everything was disappointing. 

The common room was devoid of a real fountain — the one present was mural and not working. The cleanliness left much to be desired: stained sofas and chairs, the bed in the room with blood-stained pillowcases, sheets with hair and visibly dirty, as well as pierced and frayed towels. 

On the rooftop, the tub was CLOSED, covered with a filthy tarp, accompanied only by two deckchairs thrown there to make a scene. The breakfast was monotonous, without any variant, and the coffee really bad. The humidity was oppressive everywhere, especially in the room, where the situation was even worse. But the icing on the cake? Cockroaches in the room and even on this occasion apologizing was superfluous 

Despite all the inconveniences and errors found, no one has ever apologized to us.

After reading the previous reviews, I wonder: maybe the other guests saw this place with pink glasses... or simply, compared to where they usually live, this seemed like paradise to them?",Tripadvisor
Essaouira,Hotel,Dar Maya,Charming,"This lovely little hotel is well worth a stay in an equally lovely town. You reach the riad if you walk the 500m from Bad Marrakech and then straight forward. Cars can't reach anywhere near here. Good breakfast and fast service. There is a jacuzzi on the roof top that you can ask to use (it's included). The room was spacious with a few quirks, like a fully tiles shower/bathtub to which you will have to step into through a small stair or the glass doors into the room (curtains seals off the view). The living room they show on the pictures are a common room on the top floor where you will find books and a place to sit down and relax.",Tripadvisor

Essaouira,Hotel,Dar Maya,"A few days in Essaouira, Morocco","Riad Dar Maya, in beautiful, welcoming Essaouira, Morocco, was a real find.  With only five rooms, its is a wonderful place for those of us who like smaller, more intimate properties.  Our room and the public spaces had a soothing, minimalist design, which was quite appealing.  Everyone on the staff was very professional.  The location, deep in the old medina and very close to everything we wanted to see, including the old Portuguese battlements, was ideal.",Tripadvisor
Essaouira,Hotel,Dar Maya,A calm oasis,"A five room boutique riad, managed by Youssef who is charming, going above and beyond to help with whatever queries you may have 
The breakfasts are good:  eggs however you want them, delicious bread.  Fresh orange juice, fresh fruit salad with yogurt, sweet pancakes/a sugary bun (difficult to describe but delicious) and good coffee (or teas of your choice ).  However, for dinner I suggest you eat out.  The roof terrace is lovely but the sea views are not as spectacular as hoped for.  The decor is sophisticated- lots of marble .  The bedroom floor is very cold so do take slippers as they are not provided.  Dar Maya is ideally placed within the walls and within easy walking of interesting sights, especially the Port.   Also excellent restaurants five or ten minutes away.",Tripadvisor
Essaouira,Hotel,Dar Maya,A sanctuary,"The hardware, the interior design was better than the photographs. Muted colors, ambient candle lights in the evening, alcoves, deep marble bath, and restrained decor were so soothing, welcoming quiet time to rest, read and write. We felt 'at home'. There is no view to the ocean, but I felt it is better so. It is a sanctuary from whatever is happening outside. 

The software, I felt, needs maintenance and repair. The staff English language, the fixtures like a broken lamp, the pipes which don't drain well, and stained pillow covers... Lacking quality control, manager or owner's presence and ownership when something deviates from the normal operations.   

The hardware is so good, I am letting it go...",Tripadvisor

My room was lovely though it didn't feel like I was in Africa at all. Shower was great although my sink drained very slowly. The food for the set evening meal was interesting. I think it tried to be refined and posh but feel short in its randomness. Whole fish with cold rice. Hard spaghetti with cheese. Drinks were pricey too.,Tripadvisor

Breakfast is fruit, pastries, orange juice, bread, scrambled eggs and coffee or tea. At the price we paid (about 800 dihrams/night) it was a good deal. The best aspect of our visit was our the welcome from our hostess, Amina, who seems to do everything (front desk, cooking, cleaning). Amina was very kind and sweet, and immediately responded to any of our questions or wishes. It shows how just one staff person's hospitality can make a visit enjoyable and worth returning to the hotel.",Tripadvisor

Francoise went above and beyond to help with recommendations and restaurant bookings and we enjoyed our stay so much because of her. The riad itself is small, but has everything you need and good breakfast cooked by Amina. The bed was very comfortable but I would say the pillows need changing as they were a bit old and clumpy.

Initially, we planned to stay 3 nights, but the comfortable rooms, sunny terrace, and above all else, the dedicated and lovely staff inspired us to stay much longer.

The place is clean and beautifully decorated with local art and furniture. The rooftop terrace offers a nice opportunity to sun bathe, with a fair amount of cover from the ever strong winds.

Our trip was made especially lovely by the ever smiling and supporting staff. I got food poisoning by eating at the fish market, upon which the cook made us a soup for dinner twice in a row and the staff brought up medicine and a thermometer to our room.

Overall, it really was a home away from home. Highly recommend.",Tripadvisor
Essaouira,Hotel,Dar Les Sirenes,A true gem!,"We have stayed at three other riads in Essaouira over the past two years. We rated this riad the best for the following reasons: 1) The morning breakfast was exceptional. 2) The staff were friendly, and helpful. They went out of their way to accommodate when we asked anything of them. We asked for Berber Eggs one morning and they made them for the following day. Another day asked for some dry cleaning to be done, which was quickly procured. Great people as well! 3) The rooftop terrace was large and inviting 4) The room was clean, and large and had a small balcony. We realize that we probably had one of the largest rooms, but all the rooms we saw were unique and nice. I would have to say that you will not be disappointed in choosing this riad.",Tripadvisor
Essaouira,Hotel,Dar Les Sirenes,Oh dear!,"The bed was very comfortable and the linen good. The architect who designed it must not have thought how awkward to actually stay and use the place. Polished grey concrete bathroom with a bow balanced on a stand, not bathroom shelf. The bedroom, a cell, one tiny window up against the city wall so no view and not much light, the other window onto the landing so curtain had to be closed . Breakfast, whilst served and prepared by a lovely young lady, was chaotic,she obviously had no training. No, do not recommend The rooftop terrace had paint and plaster falling off the walls, the 2red “sunloungers” were fit for the scrap heap and the other seating was tired.Dying plants wonky parasols. In need of some upgrading",Tripadvisor

Essaouira,Hotel,Hotel Ocean Vagabond Essaouira,Cute hotel with great location,"We were given a free upgraded room which was not expected but appreciated. The hotel is in need of some TLC, the door to the balcony rubs against the floor, the door for the bathroom was covered with dust, the toilet did not flush properly and the shower head wouldn’t sit right. For breakfast in the morning only half the tables were set up properly (cutlery, napkins etc). Breakfast wasn’t very good and service was off, we received our jams after all the food was served so it was quite pointless and the coffee cups were dirty.",Tripadvisor

The staff is really nice and polite too. You are really close to the old city of essaouria- about 5 min walking. If your holidays are about surfing it’s a real long walk to all the surfing schools and the good surfing spot - around 25 minutes.
You can really here the cars from the room because there is the Main Street. So If you are a light sleeper you should book the room which is NOT facing the sea, because there is also the main road.
In general it’s a real cute little hotel :)",Tripadvisor
Essaouira,Hotel,Hotel Ocean Vagabond Essaouira,Nice but some improvement needed,"The hotel is nice bud old.

The doors from the balkony don't close properly as some others also.
The furniture is very old and not in a good condition.
The dishes are not cleaned very well.
The breakfast is too sweet, not really healthy.

For now it's not worth the price.

But, the staff is very very friendly, the garden is soo beautiful and the pool is nice.
The hotel is just in front of the Medina, the location is perfect.

If the management would improve the kitchen staffs training and do some smaller maintenance it would be a really great hotel.

If the management would improve some things and trained the stuff well it could be a superb hotel.",Tripadvisor
Essaouira,Hotel,Hotel Ocean Vagabond Essaouira,Very good value. Fantastic staff,"Loved our stay here. Noureddine and the other staff were wonderful and did everything they possibly could to male our stay comfortable.
If you are looking for a generic 4* hotel then this isn’t for you. It feels more like a big Riad and more homely.
The rooms could do with a little updating. The wooden bed frames creaked VERY loudly and it took some investigation to work out that a kink in the shower hose was causing low water pressure.
But for the price this was great and I would definitely stay again.

Essaouira,Hotel,Hotel Ocean Vagabond Essaouira,Dirty and bad condition,"The building has a lot of potentiall but for us it seems like the management and the sense for proper service has left the building. For this price we expected a lot more. The towels and sheets are old and have permanent stains. At breakfast, the plates were chipped and not washed properly, and the tablecloths were dirty. The location is also very noisy and the windows doesn’t shut properly. However, the staff were kind enough to let us change rooms to one with a bit less noise.",Tripadvisor

Hotel is “tired”
Would be simply beautiful if it was done up.
Towelling robes and towels are old as are pool lounger covers.

Faulty towers element:- blew fuses in room on day one and shower head fixture fell off! All fixed that day.

Water plentiful and hot so had lovely bath.
Rooms with sea view are super others a bit dank!!

Good breakfast.

You pay for bottled water after small bottle in room has gone.

No lifts and rooms over 3 floors.

However close to beach and medina Lots of choice to eat.

Essaouira,Hotel,Hotel Ocean Vagabond Essaouira,Totally overpriced and very run down!,"This was an incredible disappointing hotel! After paying a premium price for the stay we had an expectation to receive a certain standard of quality.

The building is incredibly run down. Towels are badly stained and frayed on the edges. There was a blood stain one of the pillows. Water does not drain from the sink in the bathroom. Bathroom window can't be opened without it dropping completely on the toilet. Windows and door t balcony didn't lock. Overall the room smelt of mould and it was very dusty. Hotel food was also terrible! Breakfast as well as lunch/dinner offering.

We moved to Le Médina Essaouira a block away for the same price. It was an exceptional improvement!",Tripadvisor

Essaouira,Restaurant,Umia,A wonderfully comfortable intercultural dining experience.,"We had a wonderful experience at Umia, so good we ate there one night and chose to eat there the next night as well. The restaurant is lightly modern in style and the host/owner is gracious and welcoming. The owner is, we believe, Moroccan, married as he told us to an Italian and the restaurant reflects that cultural mix. The food was superb, a mix of offerings that were Moroccan and continental, with a nice mix of offerings including some superb beef and fish carpaccios.  The six of us just had a lovely time and, having been in Morocco for almost three weeks found the mix of dishes refreshing.  The service was excellent and friendly, making you feel most welcome in Englis, Frech and, although we did not speak it, obviously Arabic. The wine list was good and reasonable. So too were the prices, certainly not inexpensive but also not over the top. The noise level was moderate, certainly not intrusive. We just had an excellent experience an would highly recommend Umia.",Tripadvisor

Essaouira,Restaurant,Triskala Café,Average food and unfriendly staff,"My friend had walked past Triskala and liked the look of it. We read the reviews online and, even though the menu looked limited with just three starters and three mains, it looked interesting. A small menu is generally a good sign, as it usually indicates that food is freshly prepared although, on the other hand, it can be a struggle if the choices don’t appeal.

We made a reservation but, unfortunately, on the day we visited, I wasn’t keen on the mains so I ended up ordering two starters. The sweet potato and fennel soup was quite nice, although there was not much taste of fennel, and the portion size was extremely small. The accompanying homemade olive bread was delicious and my other starter of sardine croquettes was very tasty. We both had kombucha to drink and shared a dessert of panna cotta, both of which were nice.

I didn’t find the staff to be friendly, starting with our early arrival for our 6.30.p.m booking when we were refused entry until exactly 6.30.p.m, even though the doors were wide open and there didn’t seem to be anything happening inside. Being made to wait outside for no obvious reason (thankfully it wasn’t raining!) seemed petty and I would say that the staff in this restaurant were the least friendly and welcoming of anywhere we visited in Essaouira. Once inside, and seated (the seating is not very comfortable either!), the other tables filled up quickly and there was a nice relaxed atmosphere, with a bit of a bohemian vibe to the place which seemed to be very much in keeping with the mainly young-looking clientele.

Prior to eating, we’d become aware that the food is sustainably sourced from the restaurant’s own permaculture farm where you can also go to eat. Although the farm is roughly a half hour drive from Essaouira, we actually said we’d have visited for a meal on another day, had our meal at Triskala not been a very average dining experience. Whilst the restaurant’s green ethos, which includes not using plastic and only serving filtered water or water in glass bottles, is commendable, my food in particular was just average and failed to live up to expectations.",Tripadvisor

My zucchini- wrapped sardine croquettes were  delicious as was a gently seasoned octopus salad.

We could clearly feel the presence of saffron, with its delicate and slightly earthy aromas, which give the dish this golden yellow color so typical. The meat broth had a nice depth, and the freshly grated Parmesan added a touch of character without masking the other flavors.

The setting of the restaurant is simple, warm, with a sincere atmosphere that immediately puts at ease. It feels like being welcomed at home, but with the refinement of real Italian cuisine.

This pizzeria was a real surprise: light dough, well leavened and with that authentic flavor that only a real Italian pizza can have. The ingredients were fresh, from stringy mozzarella to tasty tomato, and cooking in a wood oven made a real difference.

The atmosphere was simple but welcoming, with a Mediterranean touch that makes you feel at home. Friendly and helpful staff, and prompt service without hurry. An excellent alternative if you want to change a little from local dishes and enjoy a moment of “made in Italy” taste.

Highly recommended if you are looking for a corner of Italy in the heart of Morocco!

Essaouira,Restaurant,Taverna bolognese da Maurizio,5 star food. 3 star service,"I need to stress up front that the food here was fantastic and the staff were very friendly. We shared a Burrata as a starter and had fresh, hand rolled pasta as a main each (I had the bolognaise and my partner had a vegetarian option). We also ordered sparkling water and wine. The starters arrived with no sign of any drinks, which I had to chase for twice. The starter was very good indeed, but we had not finished it when our mains arrived. At this point our unfinished starter was whisked away from us to make room on the table, leaving us to dive straight into our mains. The mains were both excellent and the pasta truly was handmade and of excellent quality. At the end of the 2 courses, we were left with a considerable amount of wine to consume and so decised to take a punt on dessert. The dessert menu duly arrived, but after 20 minutes or so nobody had taken our order so we decided to call it a day. The food was amazing and the staff were all very nice and friendly, but I can't help but feel that they could do with a bit more training and coordination to male this place a truly great experience.

The setting itself is beautiful—secluded, with an oasis-like atmosphere and authentic decor that should make for a truly memorable visit. The promise of cheese and wine to round off the meal was especially enticing.

However, the reality didn’t quite match up. When we arrived, the restaurant was completely empty. While this might be due to visiting during the off-season, it did make us wonder about its usual appeal. The menu structure was another letdown—you couldn’t simply choose a dish but had to commit to a full four-course menu. Unfortunately, the food was bland and uninspiring, making the wait for the cheese feel longer than it should have. And even when we finally got to the much-anticipated cheese, it turned out to be a selection of the same type at different aging stages, and found both a hair and a fly squashed into the pieces—not quite what we had hoped for.

Another disappointment was the lack of drink options. With only water available and no wine or even soda to accompany the meal, the experience felt incomplete.

This restaurant has everything it needs to be an incredible dining destination—the ambiance, the concept, and the potential for a great culinary experience. But based on our visit, it fell flat. Hopefully, with some adjustments, it can live up to its potential.",Tripadvisor
Essaouira,Tourist+Attraction,La Fromagerie,Not seduced,"We stopped there to buy cheese only. So no review about the restaurant but we didn't really like the place... an Impression of little maintained from the parking lot, not many people to welcome visitors, closed and uninvolving pool, statues of women who are almost scary... but probably we understand nothing about ""art"" and their little panties... 
The displayed menu proposals seem correct although simple and of a rather high Award. But we would have to test to know the value for Award and we did not want it at all, too bad.
FYI still good goat cheese but disappointed by the cow.",Tripadvisor
Essaouira,Tourist+Attraction,La Fromagerie,Disappointing. Surprised this is recommended so highly!,"Having read such positive reviews on trip advisor we decided to visit here for lunch. We were the only people there, which is slightly off putting, but thought we’d give it a go. Menu is quite  limited. We all chose the vegetarian option. Mise bouche was good but then  I was served a cheese croquette that was solid so I couldn’t eat it. Then a bowl of basic salad leaves with some goats cheese crumbled on top. Then a plate of tasteless cheese to finish. We tried to eat some but it just wasn’t enjoyable so we left it, paid and departed. Surprised this is rated so highly! We can’t recommend it.",Tripadvisor

Essaouira,Tourist+Attraction,La Fromagerie,Mediocre in terms of the setting and the quality of the food. Day-old bread. No cleanliness and above all poor decoration,The cheese factory without being able to buy a cheese! Stale bread.

A place which seems to be at the end of its life... It must have been nice, there was an effort at decoration but there was no has more than that in memory. The quality of the food is deplorable, a piece of stale barbecue and above all a lot of cheese that almost makes you vomit... For a price bordering on the indecency of a European capital. And above all, don't take the vegetarian one, you will have cheese for the rest of your life if you empty your wallet... the quantity is insufficient and the service is not provided or to be provided... Really move on, please.. You will be doing business a favor.",Tripadvisor

Beautiful riad but it’s the staff that makes it so very special. Food is to die for. Every night we sat on the upstairs deck enjoying the beautiful prayers coming from the miniarets. So lovely. Again, I can’t say enough about the women working at the riad. They should come to the u.s. and give lessons on kindness and grace. Truly amazing!",Tripadvisor

Great place to stay. ,Tripadvisor

Everyone we encountered were so pleasant and accommodating (from reception, to staff serving meals and housekeeping).  We were on the 4th floor (had lots of steps to get there) but the view from our terrace was worth it !  They even brought our dinner to our room one night !  The room was quite comfortable, a bit on the small side, but we felt right at home.

Chefchaouen,Hotel,Lina Ryad & Spa,As close to perfection as possible,"This is a really comfortable Riad that gave us such a warm welcome! The Riad sent men to come down to the edge of the Medina to meet us and collect our bags. They also carried our suitcases up to our room on the top and back down to the car park when we left.
It’s in a great spot where you can walk around and lose yourself but get back with google maps! Breakfast was delicious with a selection of breads, savoury and sweet, yogurt, fresh fruit, and eggs served however you like them.
We also had dinner at their restaurant and I had a delicious baby goat tagine. We had a couple Hammam too which was our first time - I’ve never felt so clean and my skin was so soft 
Excellent staff 
Highly recommend",Tripadvisor
Chefchaouen,Hotel,Lina Ryad & Spa,,"This place was amazing.  The service was remarkable from start to finish.  Examples:  
 - We asked for someone to meet us at the CTM bus terminal, and the Manager herself met us as we walked off the bus, she arranged the taxi, rode with us to the Medina Gate where we were met by a porter who took our three heavy bags and led us right to the place.  
 - Lunch was prepared for us from scratch and was delicious.
 - We had the room on the 4th (top) floor (room #5) which was absolutely spotless and beautiful.
 - But the Rooftop Terrace was the unexpected surprise - the view was absolutely amazing, and was accessible from our living room doors.  
 - In the evening we went to the lobby to relax and immediately mint tea and cookies appeared, at no charge and without asking.
 - The breakfast was freshly prepared for us and delicious.
 - We had the same service when we left - the porter carried our bags again, walked us out to the gate and got us a taxi.  

This was five star all the way.  I highly recommend this to anyone staying in Chefchaouen.  We almost extended our stay we liked it so much.",Tripadvisor
Chefchaouen,Hotel,Riad Baraka,Worst hostel host ever,"No one works on site during reception hours. System for checking in is excruciating... we also communicated several times with the manager by phone and text messages, but no answers to enlighten us. The manager also tried to scam us by raising the price of $100 and then blamed the “error” on his receptionist which he confirmed we did not have later. The manager also said that he did not receive our payment afterwards. We were asked to leave the money on the desk in the entrance in plain sight and with many passers-by who had access... The person in charge is aggressive and stupid. When we tried to talk to him face to face twice, he left saying he would be back in 1 minute and never came back even 1h30 after. Constantly lacks toilet paper. Lunch between 9am and 10.30am, but on our two days of visit there was none despite being included. Fortunately the view from the rooftop was beautiful, but the inconvenience caused by the service is unfortunately not worth it.",Tripadvisor
Chefchaouen,Hotel,Riad Baraka,Amazing hostel,"DO NOT STAY HERE! I’ve stayed at many hostels, some being worse rated advertised than this but this is the worst by far! So much misadvertisement. From the start the host wasn’t there when we arrived and gave us no check in instructions. We had to figure it out for ourselves. Finally we found the “owner who doesn’t work there just lives there” who got angry at us as we were impeding on his only free time at 4pm. We were given incorrect rooms to what we booked and paid for and were told to deal with it. He then got angry for not giving him the money we owed as he wasn’t there on arrival to give it to. We got the cash and gave it to him and he told us he would give the change later which we never received. He was rarely on site and was rude and ignorant with small things such as asking for toilet paper he said he’d get around to it later and never do it. He also has a brother or friend who lives or stays there. We had a confrontation with the owner over an incident which we aimed to handle peacefully but we were met with swearing and yelling and the brother got involved getting in our faces and getting hands on even picking up glass and threatening us. The breakfast is a plate of croissants and cake nothing else so no buffet or variety. He was also seems sleeping on the floor of the rooftop one night. Most unpleasant workers and hosts ever and most unpleasant experience. Don’t get fooled by the pictures and description because the host runs it so poorly",Tripadvisor

Not only because it was clean and has such good atmosphere but the owners Joe and Trevor went out of their way to make us feel welcome. They had a lot of tips on where to visit, eat and go and even recommend a lovely local hamam for a non touristy hamam experience.

Chefchaouen,Hotel,Riad Baraka,Just bad,"My boyfriend and I stayed here for 4 nights. On arrival Joe (the main host) was attentive, gave us a tour, filled us in on the details and showed us our room. He was a really nice and friendly guy and made us feel comfortable from the beginning! We stayed in a private room with a fan which was very nice. The whole place was decorated beautifully, especially the terrace where everything was blue (to match the blue city). The location was perfect; inside the medina but close to a gate. There were plenty of places to eat, shop, and chill and Joe would direct us or even take us himself when we wanted to go somewhere. Mohammed also worked there, he was super friendly, attentive and helpful too. We managed to make friends with the other people staying - people usually hang on the terrace but it's nothing crazy- very chilled and nice vibes. I would definitely recommend especially if travelling alone and wanting to meet people :))) thank you Joe and Mohammed!

Chefchaouen,Hotel,Riad Baraka,,"This is a nice looking hostel. That's the only good thing I can say about it. The manager and owner are rude and abusive to the guests. There's no security here. No lockers, no locks on the bedroom doors. No kitchen, no doors on the bathrooms, which is weird. Stay somewhere else. I don't expect to be shouted / swore at and generally treated like a nuisance. Just not good",Tripadvisor
Chefchaouen,Hotel,Dar Jasmine - Chefchaouen,Best Hotel Experience in Morocco,"We just returned from a trip to Morocco staying in 7 different hotels in 7 cities. Dar Jasmine was the best of the lot. Yes, you do have to climb (158) steps to reach the hotel. The luggage is brought up or down by porters of the hotel. Once you reach the hotel, the breathtaking view, the excellent service, the pool - compensates for all the calories you spent. Dinner and breakfast on the terrace, overlooking the city and the valley is priceless. The service by the staff was equally welcoming.

Pool is lovely and also has a nice view of the town. Lovely sunbeds and fine towels. 

Room is fully equipped, housemade cookies on arrival and here also a great view of the town.

We learned late at night that our ferry the following day was cancelled and we had to leave early in the morning to catch a different ferry.

The hotel has porters to bring up your luggage from the road -- be sure to tip them. We stayed in the Jasmine room, which had a great view and a patio but the decor is tired and the room had an overwhelming smell of jasmine from a plant spring that was left in the room (we tossed those out ASAP). The bed was uncomfortable and the hotel did not have mattress toppers. The pillows were also not great. We had dinner at the hotel, which was just ok (you must bring your own alcohol) but leisurely and the view is lovely.

It’s just a few rooms with a small staff of two, but is taken care of well with a great breakfast included on the rooftop terrace. Clean and everything needed is provided. The staff doesn’t speak much English but is still very helpful and everything needed gets done. Also worth nothing that it’s located at nearly the top of the hill of Chefchaouen— not good if you don’t want to walk up and down stairs a lot. Would highly recommend.",Tripadvisor
Chefchaouen,Hotel,Casa La Palma,Finding a home in Chefchaouen,Rafik treated us like good friends and we were sad to leave.

Chefchaouen,Hotel,Casa La Palma,Some of the Best Service Anywhere,"This place was charming and very tranquil — done up in a traditional Moroccan style in a lovely part of the old city. The breakfast was very good and can be eaten on the roof with a fantastic view of pretty much the entirety of Chefchaouen and the surrounding valleys. The staff at this hotel is quite possibly the nicest I've had anywhere. Apart from carrying my heavy bags from the city gate (which, fair warning, is a bit of a walk up and down several stairs - as is everything in this city) to the hotel (then back when I checked out), the desk clerk arranged for a car to take me about an hour and a half away to see the shrine of Sidi Abdesselam. Beyond that, he took me personally downtown to a tailor shop so I could get some pants tailored — something above and beyond anything that could conceivably be in his job description. And he did everything with a smile on his face and without ever making me feel like I was inconveniencing him. The only thing to be aware of is that Chefchaouen is built along a giant hill, and this hotel is pretty close to the top of it - so be ready to do a bit of walking going to and from the main parts of the city which are mostly down the hill. On the plus side, the location is really much more in an authentically old neighborhood of town rather than an area where you're likely to mostly run into tourists (or people trying to sell you things...) -it feels alive and real, which is nice. This hotel is an excellent choice!",Tripadvisor

Chefchaouen,Hotel,Casa La Palma,Very Nice Bed & Breakfast,"We were warmly greeted by the owner and his helper up at the car park, which was so helpful as we had lots of luggage that would have been challenging to carry. It was only a 5 minute all-downhill walk from the parking area.

The B&B is very nice. All 3 rooms that we reserved for our 2 night stay were spotless and clean. Nice en suite bathrooms. The beds were very comfortable. We enjoyed the rooftop sitting area. Breakfast was quite nice as well. The owner helped us reserve a table at Cafe Sophia, which we liked very much. We also appreciated his early morning assistance with our baggage on departure day. Only minor issue was his credit card machine didn’t work that morning, but we were lucky to have enough cash on hand to cover.",Tripadvisor

Şafşavana bir daha gitsem hiç düşünmem yine bu mekana giderim.

The food is amazing, and the location of the place is excellent. I had the lamb tagine with prunes and almonds — it was wonderful, even though I don’t usually like red meat. I tried it based on a recommendation, and now I recommend it too. The falafel was tasty, but the portion was small.

Chefchaouen,Restaurant,Restaurant Beldi Bab Ssour,A peasant meal and evening at Bab Ssour,"While exploring the distinctive blue streets of Chefchaouen, finding Bab Ssour was a pleasant discovery. From the moment we entered, the atmosphere felt warm and inviting. The staff were notably friendly. Their welcome felt sincere, contributing to a comfortable sense of hospitality that set a positive tone for the meal. Simple things like the menu in multiple languages added to the experience.

Choosing from the menu was made easier by the helpful staff at Bab Ssour. When I mentioned I was unsure what to order, they took the time to discuss the options and offered good recommendations based on my preferences. It was clear they knew their menu well and aimed to ensure guests had a rich experience.

The food itself was very good. Following their suggestions, we enjoyed Moroccan flavours. The dishes tasted fresh and seemed carefully prepared. We thoroughly enjoyed Baisara, Lentil soup and the Moroccan mint tea. The goat tagine was tender and well-spiced. We capped the meal with their delicious yoghurt as dessert (caveat: it was very sweet, but we decided are on a holiday).

For those seeking good, authentic Moroccan food served by welcoming staff who make you feel comfortable, Bab Ssour is a solid choice. It's certainly a great choice if you're in the area.",Tripadvisor

The food was perfection - we had bread, olives, 5 Moroccan salads, 2 Harira soup, oxtail tagine and goat tagine and two homemade lemonades.and it came to less than £18 for the pair of us. Helpfully a man noticed we were looking a little lost on the main road and guided us up.

Chefchaouen,Restaurant,Restaurant Tissemlal of Casa Hassan,Ordinary cuisine in an exceptional setting ...,"With each visit to Chefchaouen, I have become accustomed to stopping at Casa Hassan’s restaurant for the pleasure of seeing its evolution – and it is always interesting to see the regular reinvestments in the decoration of the places, which improve year after year. This treatment for aesthetics makes the place really nice and invites to relax.

In terms of health and freshness, this is a sure thing: we feel that quality and food safety are at the heart of their priorities, which is reassuring. However, at the culinary level, the experience unfortunately remains ordinary. With such an exceptional setting, it is a little disappointing not to find local specialties that would showcase the talent of the Chaouenie cooks. Portions, especially for some tagines, are sometimes ridiculously small, which can leave a taste of unfinished.

In short, Casa Hassan’s restaurant is a charming and safe place for a meal, but could gain authenticity by integrating more local flavors. A suggestion for future visits: bet on a touch of locality, it would add a nice added value to the experience!",Tripadvisor

Thank you heartily to Said, Mohamed and the whole team. Thanks to you, Dar Kamar will always have a special place in our hearts.",Tripadvisor
Ouarzazate,Hotel,Dar Kamar,Outstanding 2 night stay,"Having recently stayed 2 nights in the Dar, we can only describe the place as exceptional. Mohammed and Sahid were fantastic hosts, friendly, helpful and extremely knowledgeable, dealing with many enquiries ahead of our stay too. Although we didn't have contact with the other staff, they all do a brilliant job in making sure that your stay is a high quality experience. We ate dinner both nights in the Dar and the food was an extremely high standard and delicious. Good to see that Moroccan wines are served, the red wine was definitely more drinkable than the rose!! We had a look at all of the rooms and each have their own uniqueness. I can't imagine that there is a better place to stay in Ouarzazate for location, service and experience. We don't usually return to the same place twice, but have vowed to return ahead of our next trip into this region of Morocco and the desert.",Tripadvisor
Ouarzazate,Hotel,Dar Kamar,A nice but hidden place to stay,"Just like other places I stayed, getting to the hotel was hard. Our group traveled on a bus, so we were not able to get close as there were narrow alleyways to the hotel. It was a short hike going to or away from the hotel. The interior had a charming look. The restaurant had both indoor and outdoor seating but it was located on the top floor. You had to climb the stairs as there were no elevators.",Tripadvisor
Ouarzazate,Hotel,Dar Kamar,Gorgeous riad with super honest price,Truly tastefully renovated. Beautiful terrace on the Kasbah. Better to book directly at the hotel to get a room upgrade.

Ouarzazate,Hotel,Dar Kamar,Dar Kamar is a great place to stay!,"This is a really interesting place to stay-it is located in a 17th century courthouse! It is nicely located, next to the Kasbah and within walking distance to an arts center. Our room was really spacious and beautifully decorated. Breakfast was delicious.
Our only disappointment was in one of the employees-he actually cheated us out of some money! We paid for some laundry but did not have exact change, so this man said that he would get change and bring it to our room. He never did and when we went to look for him, he was gone and even the next day when we looked for him-they said he wouldn't be in till later. We had to leave, so that was that. It was not much money, but it is the principle of the thing! So beware of the man who works there and wears a short brimmed fedora!",Tripadvisor
Ouarzazate,Hotel,Ouarzazate Le Riad Hotel,Great stay!,We stayed just for one night. Too short! But the staff is very friendly and our room was very big! We had a parking spot in front of the Hotel and the breakfast was varied. We would recommend this place and would love to come back :),Tripadvisor

Our room was spacious with nice bathroom and even with fridge. The pool is amazing and very clean! Breakfast was one of the best we had - huge variety of savoury/sweet. And a big plus was a bar opened till midnight which served beer (25 dirhams for Flag).",Tripadvisor
Ouarzazate,Hotel,Ouarzazate Le Riad Hotel,Unable to check-in and lied to us,"We made a room reservation for 9 people 4 double rooms and 1 single by Booking.com for the hotel and when we tried to do the check-in the receptionist told us he was not finding the booking, though we showed him the booking confirmation with the code number and all that. Facing this situation, instead of being honest with us (overbooking, problems with Booking.com, whatever he could have said..) he asked us to see the price that we were paying, and then told us we were in the wrong place, and that we should go instead to the Le Zat hotel because they belonged to the same company and the conditions were the same. Upon our arrival to the new place, they were indeed waiting for us, but then they explained us that they have nothing do to with Ouarzazate Le Riad company and they accepted us because this same hotel asked them. Ultimately, we paid the price to stay in Ouarzazate Le Riad with interior and exterior pool, sauna, and in the end we ended up in a totally different hotel without having a clue of the reason.",Tripadvisor
Ouarzazate,Hotel,Ouarzazate Le Riad Hotel,Nice quality price,"Sometimes I can't understand some people's reviews. You go to a hotel for 15€ each per night and you expect it to be the Palace or the Ritz? There is a five stars hotel near by for 180€ per night. If you want quality, pay the price. Beautiful hotel with not high maintenance and so so breakfast, but huge rooms with comfy beds, huge swimming pool and located in a near by area. Lovely staff. Sometimes people are so demanding and they don't want to pay much. If you bring your baby to Morocco for a desert trip, you have a problem, demanding person.",Tripadvisor

But our bathroom was not clean, the water was leaking all over the toilet. And the room was very noisy at night. We don’t give a worse review because the bed was clean and comfortable.
The service was really bad - made promises, they didn’t approve and were really unfriendly.
And regarding breakfast: It just was not very tasty, but OK.
Our conclusion: There is definitely better value for your money in Ouarzazate!",Tripadvisor
Ouarzazate,Hotel,Ouarzazate Le Riad Hotel,Poor hotel. Not recomendable,"Poor and old hotel. Hotel service really bad. No amenities in the bathroom, and if you ask, they give a small mini bag of soap, like in the worst motel. About the breakfast. Poor and really bad quality.
Dont come.",Tripadvisor
Ouarzazate,Hotel,Ouarzazate Le Riad Hotel,Only good to use for sleeping!,"The hotel and room we were in are presented well and kept clean. However the amenities are sparse with no facilities to make tea/coffee in the rooms - something I missed a lot the week we were staying there.

The food at breakfast was sparse. With not a lot of options, you weren't able to make breakfast interesting.

Asking the staff for anything extra (like hot water for tea) was a pain, as they didn't like to provide it all the time. During the day and after dinner service there were no staff around to ask for help apart from the reception. There was no way to get food or drinks without going into town unless it was breakfast or you paid for dinner.

Overall, as a base of operations to go to other places it is fine. The beds are comfortable and rooms clean, with the staff being agreeable to most requests.",Tripadvisor

Ouarzazate,Hotel,Maison d'hôte La Rose Noire,un riad extra,"Three great days and an interesting and rewarding sharing in a riad as we would like to find
 
Liked · a super friendly welcome with drinks , a large and very clean room, explanations about the city and customs and full of Tips for Things to Do, a hearty breakfast and served at the time we chose (we are late bunks and late risers, bottle of fresh water offered several times, efficient air conditioning (fortunately it was over 40°), impeccable bedding nothing to blame

Did not like · shutters or blackout blinds but good not be too demanding!!!",Tripadvisor
Ouarzazate,Hotel,Maison d'hôte La Rose Noire,Very nice stay in historical riad,"First of all - you need to have a lot of cash (Euros or MADs), you never know when you gotta spend it at riad - taxi both ways from/to the airport, city tax (because WiFi at the receptionist's computer & terminal didn't work, by in our phones did so we needed to go to town centre late evening extremely tired after three days excursions because we were only 10 euros short and not able to pay via card and we were back to our country the next morning...) - hence one star less - not sure about this ""lie"" about not working WiFi?

Otherwise, it was an awesome riad. It was clean, quiet, and friendly, and it had a good breakfast, comfortable beds, and a working toilet and shower. There was nothing not to be happy about. It is in very safe surroundings, so we were not likely to be lost around as we first thought. I would definitely recommend it. Thanks!",Tripadvisor
Ouarzazate,Hotel,Maison d'hôte La Rose Noire,A nice place to stay.,"Having stayed in Kasbah Taourirt previously (but in a different hotel), I was somewhat familiar with its maze of alleyways.  But my taxi dropped me off near the rear of the kasbah, and the driver asked what we thought was a random stranger who just happened to be standing there how to get to La Rose Noire.  Coincidentally, that ""random stranger"" turned out to be the manager, so I had no issues finding the place!  Even so, it really is not as difficult to find as some people have made out in the comments.  The alleyways are well lit, and there are signs pointing the way.  But don't expect perfectly-paved streets, it is an ancient kasbah, after all.  Just enjoy the authenticity!  

Some reviewers have mentioned that they were disturbed by the call to prayer from the neighbouring mosque, although I can't say that I even noticed it!  But maybe I've just come to expect it in Morocco over quite a number of visits, and have learned to tune it out.  But use that ""neighbouring mosque"" as a waypoint when finding your way to the hotel - it's the only one there is in the kasbah, you can't miss the minaret.  There are two ways in to the small square in front of the mosque - the exit on the opposite side not only has a sign pointing the way to La Rose Noire, but leads to a dead end, where you will find the hotel on the left.

I'm a fan of staying in traditional places when in Morocco, so I always try and stay in places that have Berber and Moroccan artefacts and rugs as decoration, and a history, so I was not disappointed.  I will admit that the place is quite dark, but that is often the case in traditional places as it helps to keep out the scorching summer heat.  I did have to use the torch on my phone to complete the arrival form though!

My room was large and comfortable - it even came with its own 'throne', which was nice to relax in!  The bathroom seemed to be fairly new, and the shower was hot and powerful.  Breakfast was the standard Moroccan fare, lots of breads of various types,  jams, spreads, tea, coffee, juice and eggs (in my case, soft boiled).  

The only negative point I will mention is that one of my windows didn't fully close properly, and on my second night there, it got very windy.  Consequently the window was blown wide open several times during the night!  Fortunately, the aircon unit kept the room nicely warm.

They will even sell you a rug or piece of Berber jewellery if you're that way inclined.  Just keep an eye on the prices!",Tripadvisor

Ouarzazate,Hotel,Maison d'hôte La Rose Noire,Journey of the Thousand and One Berber Nights,"Despite the events linked to the earthquake, we did not cancel our reservation. We do not regret it, quite the contrary. The French media focused on the destroyed buildings as if the entire region were a post-apocalyptic setting.
This is absolutely not the case, although the suffering of the victims should not be minimized.
Coming back to the Black Rose, the setting is sumptuous offering a warm welcome and exceptionally tasty traditional cuisine.
On the security side, the building is reassuring since it did not suffer any damage during the earthquake.",Tripadvisor

The family running Maison d'Hôte La Roche Noire is so incredibly hospitable.  They genuinely want to get to know their guests and ensure that you're enjoying their experience.  We were greeted with mint tea (of course).  We enjoyed a lovely, authentic dinner in the communal dinning room (all guest groups have their own tables).  Halfway through dinner the family began to dance and play drums, inviting us to join.  

Rooms are simple, but they're clean and the bathrooms were modern.  Would recommend. ",Tripadvisor
Ouarzazate,Hotel,Riad Le Petit Riad,Beautiful stay,"We spent 3 wonderful days at the Petit Riad Guesthouse in Ouarzazate.
Riad is still with a lot of tastes both inside and outside. Everything is clean and well thought out. The rooms all decorated differently are beautiful and extremely clean. The hearty and varied cuisine is delicious.  All the dishes are nicely present. The staff is very attentive. Meals (June) were served around the pool among flowers and beautiful bougainvillea.  Everything was quiet and relaxing.  In particular we thank Mr Mohamed and Mr Aimad for their professionalism and kindness.  Discreet, they were always present to answer our questions.  Thank you Mr Mohamed for always serving us our meals with a smile and kind words.
And of course, thanks to Fatima, the owner who came every morning to make sure everything was in harmony. 
This was not the first time we stayed at this riad and it will not be the last.
We wish you a very good continuation and see you soon.

The name of the hotel was a little confusing; google maps has the exact location, but the sign above the gate says “Riad salam”, staff couldn’t explain why. The hotel has everything you need, very friendly staff, swimming pools, a bar (they serve alcohol), restaurant, laundry service and so on. The place is a bit dated and the rooms are noisy, but it’s clean. I think it’s the best you can get in this price range. ",Tripadvisor
Ouarzazate,Hotel,Hotel Ouarzazate Le Tichka,"Lovely room, terrible food (worst eaten in Morocco)","We arrived not sure what to expect but we were given a lovely room with lots of space for us and the children. Unfortunately the food was terrible (think 1960s bad English buffet with tepid food and weird mixtures). No Moroccan food at all. Worst still, standards of hygiene must have been low as within 1.5 hours of eating I got a tummy bug, my 11 year old son was really ill the next day. We both ended up with terrible diarrhoea as we continued our journey. Only just recovering from it now back home. Such a shame as we ate in street markets and small cafes with no problems until here.
Lovely venue, yes its faded glory but the room we had was lovely,  just do not have anything to eat here. 
Feel sorry for the tour groups we saw. ",Tripadvisor
Ouarzazate,Hotel,Hotel Ouarzazate Le Tichka,"Nice rooms, good service, poor pool area - faded grandeur","This is a well located tourist hotel, only 10 minutes walk from the Kasbah and town centre.  And very reasonably priced. 
The service on the whole was excellent (apart from the grumpy lady cooking the breakfast pancakes!). Our room in the older part of the hotel beyond the pool, set above a courtyard, was really lovely. Spacious, cool and loved the stain glass windows. Very clean with a fridge for our water.
We joined in with the buffet dinner which was termendous value, and the salads were delicious. Felt slightly overwhelmed by 2 huge groups staying at the hotel the same night but we were allowed to sit in a separate part of the dining room from them which was good. However, they took over the whole pool area after dinner and there was not one seat to be had outside anywhere.
Sadly this hotel is really let down by the pool area. Every cushion on every sun lounger and chair was split, faded or ripped - all in a really poor state of repair. Some of the sunbeds were broken too. The step ladder going into the pool was wobbly and felt like it was going to come off, and at 4pm in the afternoon the pool looked dirty and was the coldest pool of our whole trip. It's a shame as it looks nothing like the photos, but wouldn't take too much to upgrade it all a bit.
Overall - this is okay for a quick stop over, the service was good, but the pool area was a let down.",Tripadvisor
Ouarzazate,Hotel,Hotel Ouarzazate Le Tichka,Hidden price,"It's a nice hotel, friendly people and clean pool. We had a good time until the checkout; we suddenly had to pay €36 for one bag of laundry. Also every beer was €4. Be carefull for what you do because the prices are overrated!!",Tripadvisor
Ouarzazate,Hotel,Hotel Ouarzazate Le Tichka,Great location and good facilities at a bargain price.,"This is a huge hotel and one suspects it is past its heyday.  There is a main block (Hotel Tichka) and also many rooms arranged in two storey blocks around courtyards.  (Riad Salam).  Between them is a large pool deck with bar, sun-loungers, fountains, etc.  We stayed in one of the courtyard rooms, overlooking the pool.

Room was very spacious, with two queen-sized beds.  All the amenities worked, with a particularly gushy shower and plenty of hot water.  However the bathroom was well overdue an update.

The hotel is a few minutes' walk from the centre of Ouarzazate and the CTM bus station, and also very handy for the Kasbah and the cinema museum.  We paid €30 including breakfast for two, so the faded decor and dodgy bathroom were more than outweighed by the low price.  One suspects in its heyday it would have been much busier and would have commanded much higher prices.

I quite liked staying in this almost deserted monument to another time.  Like being in a J G Ballard novel!  But the main thing for us was the practicality of the location before departing the following morning on the bus back to Marrakech.",Tripadvisor

Had to confirm with the reception that we were at the right place.

There's no elevator available but we got a room on the ground floor. We had to walk quite a distance to get to our room located on the block at the back of the main building and the pool.

Ouarzazate,Restaurant,Restaurant L'ile De Ouarzazate,Terrible experience,"Last night we drove 25 mins through rough roads from Ouarzazate, full of expectations and appetite to dine at this place. At the beginning we were excited to see people dressed in traditional costumes serving as we expected real moroccan dishes that we like so much... Only 4 or 5 dishes were available. We chose grilled beef, chicken tajine and aubergine tajine. The bread came with some sad olives (I produce olives and olive oil in Italy). The bread tasted and felt like old, cold chewing gum. The olives were tasteless olives (except the spicy ones that were impossible to eat). Then the main dishes came: the bbq meats were small pieces, dry, overcooked and just warm. The aubergine tajine was a disgrace: three slices of aubergine on top of some tomatoes with cheese. The chicken had been dropped in the tajine with the same green olives that had been offered as entrée. The flavours of the two ingredients had not been amalgamated by properly cooking together... it was like the olives were dropped on top of the chicken just before taking it to the table, resulting in a tasteless chicken without character, let alone moroccan taste...
At that point we stood up, we paid and we drove back 25 mins to town
If the whole experience had not been a really unpleasant situation were we got scammed, I wouldn't be losing my time to write a negative review to warn fellow tourists... Our strong advice is to stay far away from this place. We ended up having a pizza at a local 5 stars hotel. Horrible experience...",Tripadvisor

You are always free to choose your favorite spot for breakfast/lunch/aperitif/dinner - in the restaurant, by the basins, on the rooftopS (big enough to play tennis) overlooking mountains or on your private rooftop terrace. It's a perfect place to spend a weekend at with you favorite friends (there are 4 double - very nice - rooms) and do nothing but eat, relax, reflect over life and sunbath. The menu is very nice and so is the selection of wines/cavas.

Ouarzazate,Restaurant,CoteSud,Built as a restaurant ...,"... but actually also offers limited accommodation.   From the outset, let me say how stylish this place is.   The dream of one man, which deserves better patronage than it enjoys - I suppose one has to know it's there.   It's a bit off the beaten track and a tad contemporary/fundamental in style, which is probably why it's not particularly noticeable from outside and afar.   The inside continues the contemporary theme and is the essence of tranquility - the use of indigenous antique artifacts (doors especially) is inspired.   The owner and staff were warm, hospitable and properly attentive; the meals (dinner and breakfast) both beautiful and first rate.   We loved it and would visit again; if you get the opportunity, try it yourself, you won't be disappointed.",Tripadvisor
Ouarzazate,Restaurant,CoteSud,Wonderful food,"What a pleasant surprise.  We began with fresh rolls, crispy on the outside soft and tender on the inside.  Then a fish spread on points of toast.

It's a pity, because l stayed only one night, like it's a pity l came alone but l found good company in the GUESTS & staff.
I enjoyed sharing my breakfast very much with the birds, and l liked their different chirping.
It's so pleasant and relaxing here.
The activities are so diverse, like camel riding, the sun rising, and the sunset is fabulous. The quads and the buggies are available for your fun.
The Sahara drive with the comfortable and new 4×4 was fantastic. ",Tripadvisor
Merzouga,Hotel,Nasser Palace Hôtel & Bivouacs,Beautiful hotel and great service,"Me, my mum and my auntie julia stayed in this hotel after a night in the Sahara camp, it was so so nice! Yussef was so lovely and accommodating. The pool was perfect and the room had air con! The breakfast was delicious. I would definitely return",Tripadvisor
Merzouga,Hotel,Nasser Palace Hôtel & Bivouacs,"For a couple or family with children, it is the best choice","Hotel with super charm, family treatment, great food, and in an incomparable corner, both Nasser and Brahim will make sure that your stay is as comfortable as possible, and because this has been my sixth time and I hope to be able to repeat many more.",Tripadvisor
Merzouga,Hotel,Nasser Palace Hôtel & Bivouacs,Magic and relaxation and at the gates of the desert,"We have stayed 3 nights and we have felt at home.
The hotel has all the amenities to make you feel comfortable during your stay. The interior area has a pool and some tables where you can relax and have tea.
Every corner of the Nasser has a special charm...from the terrace where you can see the dunes and the sunrise and sunset, to the dining room or any of the sofas they have throughout the hotel to relax and unwind.
Both breakfast, lunch and dinner are very tasty and abundant, at lunch and dinner each day they serve different dishes, each one more delicious. Breakfast is also varied.
The staff and their managers make the experience even more welcoming and familiar because they make you feel at home from the first moment you set foot there.
We took several excursions, one on a camel to see the sunset in the dunes, which is something you have to experience once in your life and the other was a buggy route through the dunes as well, 100% recommended.
Without a doubt a place to return to again and again.!!",Tripadvisor
Merzouga,Hotel,Auberge Du Sud,Extraordinary site but comfort/welcome to review,"The establishment EN is divided into two: the hotel (hostel) and its spectacular (but not very clean) swimming pool and the “bivouac” located 200 meters away. We are 10 km DE Merzouga, in the extreme north DE the erg, just on the edge DE the dune zone. The place is sumptuous and very photogenic: it is its main (unique?) asset.
As for the hotel, the welcome is minimalist (no smile, no tea or anything attentive), the rooms deserve a serious blow DE renovation, the air conditioning are pushy and noisy, the interior equipment limited to the towel. We didn’t get DE pool towels... As everywhere in the south at the end of July, DE la douche water is never chilled DE: ours was definitely hot (plumbing problem). Very average service and caters a little bit (but hearty). No breakfast. Attention to emphasize: we were lent a room in the afternoon between our stay at the hostel and our night at the bivouac: very appreciable!
We're going to the bivouac on a camel DE. Big cliché for tourists but we get caught up in the game. Nothing to see on the welcome side: smile and tea/juice DE welcome. Don’t wait DE traditional tents: they are semi-solid structures, air-conditioned (!!) and very decorated in a thousand and one night. Restaurant copy/paste with hostel but okay. Breakfast just as average. Price very above the Moroccan standard (little folly but the place deserves it).
We then take you back to the hotel: perfect logistics organization.
You can skip the hostel (without interest) and spend only one night at the bivouac. Arriving at the end of the afternoon, you will enjoy DE hotel’s swimming pool (you can easily change on site) without missing either sunset (rarely visible because frequent clouds in the evening) or sunrise DE.",Tripadvisor
Merzouga,Hotel,Auberge Du Sud,Bad service,"Bad service.
There is a modern and dismissive attitude toward the driver, while in fact, he should be treated well because he plays a major and important role in the tourism sector.
Meanwhile, the spotlight is put on the guide, with accommodation provided for him, while the driver is neglected.
From my point of view, my rating for this hotel is 0.",Tripadvisor
Merzouga,Hotel,Auberge Du Sud,Bad service,"When you come with customers, you as a driver, you are not fair. There is a kind of discrimination. If you are a tour guide, they will give you accommodation, but if you are a driver, they do not give you accommodation. Expensive needs are sold to customers there. Unfortunately, there is a kind of racism towards the driver, and I do not agree with this policy.",Tripadvisor
Merzouga,Hotel,Auberge Du Sud,A dream but with some flaws,"The rooms as well as the place are wonderful, a real paradise. directly next to the dunes, really a dream.
I remove a star because I think it is one of the worst dinners made in Morocco (buffet, bad) and also the pool, to be honest, should be fixed. I don't know if it was a filter theme or anything, but we came out with green costumes",Tripadvisor
Merzouga,Hotel,Auberge Du Sud,Beautiful views,Our time here was very limited but enjoyable. The tent was comfortable and in the Dunes. Camel ride was very short but the sunset and sunrise over the Sahara was breathtaking. The buffet breakfast was limited but the dinner had more options. Both were average.

Merzouga,Hotel,Auberge Du Sud,Very very very rude staff at reception,I don’t often comment on the rudeness of staff but the hierarchy who run this place need to know how rude the reception staff are.

Merzouga,Hotel,Auberge Du Sud,Ideal location for sand dunes,"Located at the foot of the dunes, it is an undeniable attraction. The rooms are clean and well appointed. The pool is beautiful.  Small downside for the proposed restoration that is far from the standard of an establishment like this.

Merzouga,Hotel,Dar Morocco,An enchanting corner in the heart of the Sahara,"We stayed at this riad in Merzouga and it was a truly unforgettable experience. The place is lovely, attention to detail and offers all the amenities you would expect from a top Western hotel. The pool is huge and overlooks the dunes of the Sahara, offering moments of pure relaxation and breathtaking views.

The common areas are spacious and welcoming, perfect for relaxing after a day of hiking. Although the structure is newly built, the architecture and materials chosen authentically recall the traditional Moroccan style: you can breathe the real Morocco, with a touch of elegance.

The food is exceptional, very typical and rich in flavors that we have not found in other areas of the country: a real culinary discovery.
Cleanliness is impeccable, certainly superior to many Western hotels we have stayed in.

At first, the traditional bread was brought- I'm afraid it's been in the kitchen for days.
Salad is tacky.
The second courses require a separate story:
Since this region of Morocco is famous for goat meat, they decided to try goat tajin, others ordered beef tajin. In the end, everyone got a piece of bone with a scrap of meat floating in a huge amount of fat and nasty soft onions.
Nasty!

Lying on the dunes watching the stars  with Mohammed's guidance was a dream come true. I was here the last week of March and the weather was perfect but be warned it is very cold in the desert at night when you will need a warm jacket.",Tripadvisor

Merzouga,Restaurant,Riad Merzouga Dunes,Marrakech - Merzouga - Fes,"We stayed in this magical place and I was enchanted!
Not only is the Riad of high quality, despite the price being low, but the offering that the staff offers is of great value.
We took a tour in the desert, at sunset, riding a dromedary to get to the tent where we stopped to sleep (p.s. stop on the dunes to try sandboarding!). 
Dinner and live music, before plunging into the absolute silence of the desert!
The tent with amenities was the icing on the cake.
At dawn I return by dromedary to Merzouga before leaving for Fes.
My compliments to the brothers Said, Mohamed and Hassan who manage all these activities and are able to deal with all requests (even personalized ones) for excursions and overnight stays in any location in Morocco!
I recommend contacting them for any need or suggestion, as they are very helpful people.
Furthermore, with Said we traveled from Marrakech to Merzouga and during the two-day journey we learned a lot about the traditions, culture and religion of Morocco and the Berber people.",Tripadvisor

Finally, a word for the pastry chef and chef DE cuisine, all DE them named Ebrahim, whom I have not yet had the chance to meet, but whose talent is felt every bite. The exceptional quality DE the cuisine and pastries alone is enough to justify a visit to the Club.

The selection of b’stillas was also very enjoyable.",Tripadvisor

Lovely bedding and huge fluffy towels. They arranged a taxi from the airport for us and he walked us to the Riad which was great.

Rabat,Hotel,Riad Kalaa,Not what we expected at #2,"We arrived with an expectation of a lovely, comfortable place.  We were placed in the sister facility, #2, there was no sign or other indication that a riad was there.  The courtyard is open to the sky, lovely during warmer months.  In December it was cold.  A covering was pulled over, so no sun and no heaters.  Breakfast was in your coat.  Our room was 3 flights up, again not was expected.  Most room descriptions talk about ground level. The furniture was old and extremely firm, no, it was hard.  The room was cold and the only source of heat was at the end of the long room.  It was noisy as it cycled on and off all night.  It takes hours to warm up the room.  I did not take a shower the first night because I was cold, the second night the hot water heater was broken.  Internet in our room was very poor, it is better in the courtyard, but again, chilly.  The room had few, very small windows, so it was dark.  The entire room ran along the alley, so you heard every motorbike, person and cart in the alley.  It did quiet down around midnight. Not sure about the value for the price since it was booked for us by Kensington Travel as part of a package.  Don’t book based on photos. All the photos and descriptions are of their primary riad, not #2.",Tripadvisor
Rabat,Hotel,Riad Kalaa,Beautiful Kalaa 1 & 2,"I have been to Riad Kalaa many times for dinner as the food is great and the atmosphere, beautiful. But on this visit to Rabat my usual place couldn’t take us so I decided to stay at Kalaa. What a fabulous place it is. Beautiful rooms and really comfortable beds. A fabulous dinner and an even better breakfast. A special shout out to Zakaria & Hamza. Exceptional young guys who took tremendous care of us. I don’t think I’ll ever return to my usual riad now I’ve stayed at Kalaa. I stayed in Kalaa 2 in October as Kalaa 1 couldn’t take us and that is just as good although slightly further into the medina. Highly recommend both.",Tripadvisor
Rabat,Hotel,Riad Kalaa,Riad moved luggage without our permission,Terrible review because the Dar Dar Riad staff moved our luggage to Riad Kaala without our permission and when we went for check out the luggage was gone. They thought we were with tour group and we were not. And we were not ready for checkout. They lost some our luggage and now I am getting a run around to find the luggage,Tripadvisor
Rabat,Hotel,Riad Kalaa,Unclear,The structure itself would also be nice but I made a negative review and confirm my disappointment after the response of the structure on Booking: the suite I booked was described as 32. sqm in size while in the reply I was written that my room was 20 sqm.... if they had written it on Booking I would never have booked this Riad ; it annoys me the lack of clarity and the deserved rating is what I gave and I confirm it I paid the price for a room of 32 sqm and I was assigned one of 20... how to define this thing ? I call it dishonesty,Tripadvisor

The three-story layout surrounds a peaceful central pool—perfect for cooling off on warm days. The rooftop is a lovely spot to relax with tea, read, or catch the sunset. Breakfast is classic Moroccan, fresh and nicely presented. The staff are super friendly and make you feel right at home. For what it offers, I’d say the price is very fair. It’s a calm, stylish escape in the heart of the city. I’d absolutely stay here again!",Tripadvisor

Breakfast was lovingly put together.",Tripadvisor
Rabat,Hotel,Riad Zyo,Great location and new structure,"New structure, resulting, as we have been told, from the renovation of an old post office with the annexation of an old Riad. The typical atmosphere of the Riads is given by the swimming pool in the central area, the doors and windows of the rooms and some details inside. The rooms are well finished although instead of duplicate light switches (very nice diffused light on the ceiling), we would have preferred more sockets for the now numerous items to be recharged.
The location is perfect, a few steps from an area where you can park and on one of the main streets of the Medina, which allows you to return from dinner in peace and browse through the various shops still open.
The service was efficient even if we missed the classic welcome tea...
Anyway recommended!",Tripadvisor

Our deluxe room a haven, quiet and discreet, comfortable bed and top linen, including bathrobe. Being on the ground floor it remains a bit dark and sometimes passing through, but we had a great time.
There were rowdy groups, which the very kind Mahdi apologized for offering to change rooms but we did not accept, it was certainly not his fault!
Exceptional cleanliness and rich and very good breakfast. In the heart of Medina, a starting point for visiting many beauties on foot and a stone's throw from the magnificent promenade, where you can run for km undisturbed.
Returning in the evening to our nest was one of the best moments of the day!
I forgot beautiful sun terrace overlooking the rooftops! Beautiful! Thank you Mahdi",Tripadvisor
Rabat,Hotel,Riad Zyo,Disappointing,"The most beautiful ryad of our tour in Morocco BUT: very disappointing dinner, heated dishes by their own admission, on the other hand there was none of the cooks present, instead, in the morning for good breakfast. Also in the room did not work heating, making the environment extremely humid. A guy at the reception, however quite grumpy, invited me to use the blankets; however, very cold even in the common areas, in fact all• wore vests during meals. Considering that it should be a high category ryad,it is not eligible. Convenient location.",Tripadvisor

It was great to hear the Call to Prayer from the window as the mosque is quite close to the hotel. Bathroom and bed were of satisfactory standard and very clean.

The shower was nice and hot and had good pressure. The hotel is located in a very nice position, close to many shops, coffee places and restaurants.

Rabat,Hotel,Riad L'Alcazar,Beautiful and convenient place to stay in Rabat,"This is a beautiful and convenient place to stay in Rabat. The entrance is right by the street so our tour guide dropped us off directly in front of the riad and we didn’t have to walk a long way. Our tour guide preordered beef tajine with prunes for dinner before we arrived, and it was the best tajine we have had so far in Morocco. We also had Moroccan Za'alook Salad
which was very flavorful and we scooped it up with the homemade bread. George served us dinner and spoke English well. Our room had a sitting area with a couch and the bathroom on the lower floor. The bed was up a flight of stairs, but there was no railing on the outside, so I was a bit nervous about waking in the middle of the night (thus the reason for the 4 rating). We left the bathroom light on to light our way in case we woke up. The bed was comfortable and we had a good nights sleep. Breakfast was filling - we had omelettes with yogurt and fruit and Moroccan pancakes.",Tripadvisor
Rabat,Hotel,Riad L'Alcazar,"A ""wanna-be"" hotel, FAR from 5* and From ANIMAL WELL-BEING","Hotel standard for a 5* hotel, but it is far from this. Welcome and kindness are very good, rooms are nice, very cosy living rooms, but hairdrier was not working and was not changed, minibar is poor, swimming pool was closed as far as terrace was not working. No bar service at all, lunch not in the activities as far as restaurant for dinner. No a la carte menù. Not a 5* without restaurant and bar. I may close an eye on not having a spa or swimmingpool...but at least a bar should always be available. Last but most relevant, hotel declares to be in the mood of nature, so they keep a couple of little parrots in a cage in the livingroom, so tiny they cannot even fly. I asked if  parrots may fly free at least once a day and reply was NO: ""they poo and wee around...but we love animals! Tourists like them"". I strongly doubt turisti select the hotel for parrocchiale and will not have a better esperienze from that during the stay ( a working bar should have a better effect). The ehole world is going in the opposite directory in banning zoos, in letting animals free and living as their nature is. THIS IS SUSTAINABLE, ETHICAL AND COMPLIANT, WHILE HAVING PARROTS DISPLAIED IN PUBLIC IN A CAGE IS ABOMINOUS, OLD FASHIONED AND CRUEL. THEY ARE IN JAIL AND HAVE DONE NORHING BUT BEING THEMSELVES: SINGING. This makes my esperience here quite poor and I hope these 2 parrots to be left free as Soon as possibile.

Rabat,Hotel,Riad L'Alcazar,Truly special place,"We picked this place without doing much research because we were only staying one night in Rabat, and we feel like we stumbled upon a true gem. The entrance is a bit hidden but the host was waiting outside to greet us (and it’s still more accessible than the Riads that you can only access on foot - our taxi dropped us off right outside). The decor is stunning - every square inch of the place is adorned with Moroccan details. Host made us tea while he checked us in, and they surprised us with a room upgrade. The room was beautiful. Breakfast was luxurious - the courses just kept coming. Everything was delicious. We’re staying at a different (more expensive and more “luxurious”) Riad in Tangier now, and it doesn’t compare to L’Alcazar. My only suggestion would be to ask the host to show you the rooftop terrace and pool when you arrive - we didn’t discover it until right before we checked out. But even when we came back for our suitcases after we had already checked out, they offered us more tea and asked if we wanted to use the pool. Very hospitable staff, and their pride in the place is apparent. Location is great, too - walking distance to the Kasbah and the Andalusian Gardens. We loved our stay here and would highly recommend.",Tripadvisor

The design and decorations are magnificently done, with pleasant light pastel colors and an airy feel, but still keeping the charm of the over 100 year old property. Right when we walked in, we were stunned by the gorgeous mosaic at the front entrance. The rooms have high ceilings and were well-appointed, and the terrace of the riad is stunning as well, with a wonderful view over Rabat town and medina. Breakfast wasn't included (we thought the added cost was a bit high), but it didn't matter because there were some wonderful stalls and shops on the boulevard nearby. Right next to the medina, and short walk to the Andalusian gardens, the kasbah, and the ocean. Wi-Fi was excellent too, and there is a small elevator that stops on the floors as well as the lower terrace. Staff were most accommodating and helpful too.

Rabat,Restaurant,Hotel Sofitel Rabat Jardin des Roses,Club Millésime,"I am a loyal customer of Sofitel DE Rabat, where I regularly stay during my many business trips to Morocco — no less DE seven times last year!
But this time, I want to highlight not the hotel as a whole, but the Club Millésime, one DE the major assets of this prestigious establishment.

I would particularly like to salute Madame Nadia, manager of the Club, the true soul DE this elegant place with stunning views of the neighborhood. His kindness, professionalism, attention to detail and dedication DE perfection make every visit to the Club an unforgettable moment, forever remembered as a happy memory.

I would also like to congratulate Mr Youssef DEbagh, Director of Operations and recently appointed Deputy DE Mr Mohammed MBarki, General Manager of the hotel, whom I also greet with respect.
I still do not know Mr Debagh very well, but as supervisor of the Club Millésime, I can only have a very high regard for him. During DE DE last stay, I had the pleasure of meeting him, and I was touched by his kindness and proximity to the guests. I strongly encourage him to continue along this promising path.

Finally, a word for the pastry chef and chef DE cuisine, all DE them named Ebrahim, whom I have not yet had the chance to meet, but whose talent is felt every bite. The exceptional quality DE the cuisine and pastries alone is enough to justify a visit to the Club.

A big congratulations to the whole team, and a thousand apologies to those I have not mentioned but who, through their know-how and dedication, contribute to making Club Millésime a true haven DE relaxation and DE refinement.",Tripadvisor

Rabat,Restaurant,Townhouse No3,An excellent fine dining experience,"An excellent fine dining experience.
Service by the delightful Italian waitress was superb, and she knew the small but interesting menu intimately.  We plumped for the fish special which was a whole filleted sea bass shared between two of us with oven roast vegetables and triple cooked chips.  It was ll divine.  While waiting for our main course, we were served a freshly baked focaccia loaf with a spiced cannelloni bean dip and the best olive oil.  All was a delight.
Their wine list is massive - you can see the cellar through a large glass floor panel at the two tables near the window - but much of it was priced way more than our taste palette warranted (up to EUR700 a bottle).  We plumped for a EUR32 bottle of local Gozo white which was really good and complemented our fish dish.  (The lovely waitress tried very hard to soak off the label for us - my wife has collected bottle labels for years - but fell foul of the modern use of petrochemical glue which makes them impervious to hot water.  Thanks for trying, though!).

WE had Maccheroni (pasta) with pork cheeks, an outstanding dish full of flavour and I could easily have eaten a second plate. The cerviche was also outstanding as was the risotto with fresh red local prawns. This was followed by Creme brulee with ginger ice cream, made to perfection., all washed down with a bottle of Gavi.

When coming back to meknes where his family stay so we could spend time with them we decided to try book the ibis as its central and close to them. We had stayed here in May earlier this year so knew it was nice and relaxing.
When arriving the girl on reception told us we could not stay, both wearing our wedding rings having photos of proof, having my certificate of impediment from the uk to show the date of marriage both me and my partners names date of birth address etc was still not enough, she asked why his passport was not the same as mine, I responded saying he does not have visa yet which is why they are different, she asked for marriage certificate I replied everything was with solicitor for visa. I then asked to speak with a manager or supervisor she said there was nobody there. Her attitude and the way she treated me and my husband was a disgrace. I will never ever return back to this hotel. We stayed at many after our wedding and was never refused or questioned. I’m disgusted that during our honeymoon period we were refused and turned away from this international hotel.

Meknes,Hotel,Hotel Transatlantique,Hotel with character ideally placed to visit Meknes,"Seeing dire reviews of some of the 3-4 star hotels in Meknes, I initially booked the Ibis half way between the station and the old city but changed my booking to the Transatlantique as it had lovely gardens and pool in the photos.   I stayed one night and the price was only slightly more than the Ibis.  I am letting the photos speak for themselves as the hotel doesn't seem to have any recent reviews.  If you want character, space and nostalgia this is the place.  Ok, if you go down on all fours and check skirting boards you will find holes and marks but the hotel was built with quality furnishings and fittings which have lasted well.  The bedroom I had was in the newer wing and termed superior.  Classic rooms are smaller but perfectly adequate.  Breakfast was very tired and unmemorable.  Dinner was much better.  There aren't a lot of shops or places to eat in the area around the hotel but I walked down the hill to the old town in 30 mins.  Taxis are very cheap.

The garlic sauce had no piquancy and was also tasteless. The small amount of vegetables were overcooked. Breakfast was a similar disappointment. M'semn, boiled eggs and small croissant.

I'm not the type to leave comments, but this time I make an exception, because this stay was really worth it. Special mention for breakfast: a real favorite! Variety, hearty, tasty... I loved this moment every morning.

If I had to mention one small area for improvement, it would be access by car. The Riad is located a little inside the medina, which makes parking a little complicated. We had to walk a little bit on foot, but once arrived, it was well worth the visit.

Meknes,Hotel,Riad Hiba Meknes,Sublime Riad in the heart of the medina…,"A Riad where time stands still...
The rooms are beautifully arranged around the central square and on the upper floors.
The woodwork is sculpted, the plasterwork looks like fine lace, the lamps are very beautiful with their colored glasses, on the terrace side, a sheltered corner and a panoramic terrace from which you can see the peaks of Ifrane.

Very easy to access, 3 minutes from Place Ladim, once breakfast is served (coffee, tea, citrus juice, eggs and Moroccan pancakes) you will be ready to explore the medina and its many mausoleum monuments. mosques, museums where Art reigns supreme!

I loved the atmosphere of this place steeped in history and recommended it with my eyes closed…

The owner sometimes listens to Jacques Brel, when the sun has already set...

The staff speaks French, English, Italian.

Discreet and attentive, this place invites calm and commands respect.

Partygoers or drinkers refrain, that's not the style of the house or of Meknes in general.

At Riad Hiba, you will be completely disorientated, to try it is to adopt it!",Tripadvisor
Meknes,Hotel,Riad Hiba Meknes,An extraordinary Riad to visit Meknes,"This riad has been restored respecting the Art of the 18th CENTURY, plasterwork, carved woodwork, painted ceilings, period doors and locks as in the time of its first owner Minister Ben Amar...
In this place steeped in history we are very well received and even pampered, I would even say spoiled:
For example, on the first day I was invited to change rooms and the owner himself put me in the royal room.
Royal is not just the name.
The furniture, hangings and draperies take you back to the centuries when everything was sumptuous, discreet, a suite in the dark with colored glass lanterns, splendid.
Yes the room is dark but it is exactly in this setting and this atmosphere that stays in the riads should be experienced for an authentic experience and for the light there are two floors of terraces where you can relax and sunbathe and breakfast because here in the middle of February it is cool at night and 28 degrees already during the day: all the rooms are designed to keep cool.
As for the service, it's perfectly simple and tasteful, you can choose what you prefer for breakfast, either eggs or pancakes or both, and all accompanied by coffee or tea and citrus juice.
Water is very very very precious here in Morocco, it flows generously in the bathrooms of this Riad but avoiding too long showers is a little personal advice to preserve the water reserves of the Kingdom and of Meknes in particular and around the corner. from the street there is a magnificent hammam open from Thursday to Sunday.
Lose yourself in the mazes of this medina which dates from the Renaissance and let yourself be guided by merchants and artisans of all kinds, it's just fabulous here we still weave silk in small workshops, Riad Hiba is in the heart of the medina 2 minutes walk from the Imperial City, Ladim Square, 5 minutes by blue taxi from the new town.
The museum at the end of Place Ladim is a must.
To stay local I advise you to try the succulent pastries, lots of small sellers make them in the medina, you will also find spices, olives, sun-drenched fruits...along the street markets (souks).
To fully enjoy what the medina of Meknes has to offer, 4 nights at Riad d’Hiba are recommended.
An unforgettable royal stay and the great kindness of the owner and devoted Ouda and Gyslaine will be wonderful memories.",Tripadvisor

Search the streets for a place to stay and we found RIAD HIBA. So glad we did. The staff were very helpful and friendly. We got a large room near the terrace for 400dh a night including breakfast.

Meknes,Hotel,Hotel Menzeh Dalia,Pleasant hotel despite some menu flaws,Hotel correct for the price. Small rooms. Bathroom from another age. But clean and comfortable bedding. Catering (dinner and breakfast) quite indigent.,Tripadvisor
Meknes,Hotel,Hotel Menzeh Dalia,Complaint concerning the receptionist’s behaviour and the state of hygiene,"I would like to write to you to express my deep dissatisfaction with my recent stay at your establishment, the Hotel Dalia.

First of all, I would like to point out the unacceptable behaviour of the receptionist who welcomed us. His attitude was haughty and imbued with a misplaced ego, which made our arrival very unpleasant. The lack of courtesy and professionalism on his part in no way reflects the image that one should expect of a hotel of your standing.

Furthermore, I would also like to bring to your attention the lamentable state of the swimming pool and the changing rooms. The pool water was visibly dirty, and the changing rooms were in a deplorable state, both in terms of cleanliness and hygiene. A foul smell prevailed there, making access very difficult, if not unbearable.

Please take the necessary steps to ensure that this kind of inconvenience does not recur, for me as for other customers. I remain waiting for a return from you and, if necessary, a commercial gesture commensurate with the inconveniences suffered.",Tripadvisor

The breakfast was very good.
The riad was very nice decorated & we felt comfortable to chill out there. 
Abdel and his family were so friendly, we would defenitely come again!",Tripadvisor
Meknes,Hotel,Riad Idrissi,I feel scammed,"We booked a room via Booking, but we've got another room than was shown in the picture. The room was in the middle of the lobby, so we heard everyone come in and out of the riad. There were no curtains so the lights of the lobby were shining bright at our bed. Our toilet was right near a table where people would have breakfast. That's just weird. 

When we arrived, the owner wanted to 'show' us some family work. We, new in Morocco, interested and above all naive, were brought to some kind of special room. An hour later we were in kind of a price discussion. It was €750 against 'we don't want to buy anything'. He almost forced us to write down another amount but we just stood up and left. Crazy situation. 

And if you're offered to eat with the family, prepare yourself to pay MAD 125 pp. Oh, and you don't eat with the family at all. The food was really nice, but also felt like a trick. 

Wouldn't go back here. ",Tripadvisor

Meknes,Hotel,Riad Idrissi,Avoid the Riad Idrissi,"We have stayed in several hotels throughout Morocco, this is the first one where we were made to feel unwelcome, a hindrance. The hotel is clean and well kept, in a decent location for the medina - although taxi cabs do not know how to find it. However, the staff are surly. I don't believe they want guests.... unless those guests buy the rugs or jewellery 'shown' as an 'exhibition' Guests are given the hard sell - and the tone becomes less friendly when the wallet is kept shut. The children are noisy and can be heard even from the top floor as they run through the house. We were 'invited' to dine as family with the family, but served separately and ignored by the family - and then charged 125  Dirham each for a meal that would have cost maybe 50 Dirham elsewhere. Our stay was miserable and we were made to feel uncomfortable. Staying with family? Perhaps - as unwanted relatives they had to tolerate, and treated poorly. We would not recommend this, even if there were nowhere else to stay. We would not return. ",Tripadvisor
Meknes,Hotel,Riad Idrissi,Economical,"As the town of Meknes is relatively small and few tourists visit this place, there were not a great of options to choose from for accommodation. This riad is on the edge of the medina, which was convenient. However, it does not offer free parking, albeit hotel.com stated it has, and parking was 10 dirhams. The price of this riad was cheaper compared to the other ones I stayed in Morocco and it proved to have a difference. The room was smaller than the other riads and the basin was integrated into the shower area, which could be quite wet and troubling after a shower. Considering the options in Meknes, this place can be said to be very economical indeed.",Tripadvisor
Meknes,Hotel,Riad Idrissi,Quick stay in Meknes,"Nice place very Moroccan, good staff, nice food (not Hotel made).

Being on the bottom floor also comes with noise of all the people moving around the dining area which is just outside your room, you don't feel a lot of privacy. Beds were as hard as they can be.",Tripadvisor
Meknes,Hotel,Riad Idrissi,all of us felt ripped off,"Firstly I have to say, I am a backpacker who would normally stay at cheaper style places. I accept this may be a factor in my feeling about this place. ( as someone used to far lower prices in Morocco.

We were taken to the Riad, by a man in from the Medina, with out first choice being full. We felt relieved and admired the beauty of the building, drinking the mint tea given to us. We were shown a room for the 5 of us, for 850 dirhams. Which seemed alot of us, but we agreed for the one night, we also accepted a home cooked meal later.

From then it changed. We were taken to a small hole in the wall restaurant in the Medina, where we had a basic but good meal with two nice ladies serving us. We were all shocked when a bill of 550 dirhams was given to us, far higher than any of us ever paid in the country.

We then were taken to the owner's rug show, where is somewhat agressively sold one of my fellow travellers a carpet. He then tried to take us to 'cooperative', which we all turned down. We were now worried about the meal we had ordered at the riad. Again it was good, but we were charged 120 dihrams each. 

Maybe this is what normals riads, cost but for a group of backpackers these prices seemed crazy. Also in all the hostels i stayed in before and after in Morrocco, the owner never tried to sell me anything, or take me to their shops or friends shops.

I should say that the riad, is well located, clean and quite beautiful with a nice room and terrace. It was a more a problem with the owners.

We announced are unhappiness with the final bill and 100 dirhams or so was taken of our bill. But we all left feeling really unhappy and cheated. Never once did i feel this in the other 5-6 places I stayed in Morocco.",Tripadvisor

In fact, we even started talking about what happened with a girl at the reception, who was also very kind, who made us sit down and offered us some tea. At check out, however, they were so helpful that they served us breakfast early, so as not to make us leave with a hungry stomach.
The structure is beautiful and the rooftop swimming pool completes its exceptional nature. Rooms with very refined furnishings, at times the overlap of styles and materials is almost redundant, but that's okay.
However, I cannot give 5 stars because of the dinner: served to us on the beautiful terrace, overlooking the city walls and the tree-lined square, but it proved to be very, very expensive, both in relation to the average Moroccan prices but perhaps also, for the type of ingredients and quantities, to European ones.

The food was a delight, they also do excellent value set menus for only 149 Dirham. We enjoyed a great starter of soup followed by Entrocote Beef which were both delicious, we couldn't help ourselves but to try the desserts and we're thankful we did. The Apple Pie was the best ever, think of apples surrounded by crepes, you can't go wrong!

There is also a lounge club downstairs open late, should you wish to have an after dinner drink and enjoy the music they have on offer.

Thank you for having us and we hope to be able to join you again one day soon.",Tripadvisor

Meknes,Restaurant,Le Relais de Paris,THE place to eat great food in Meknes,"Having grown up in Meknes then moved to Europe, I know only too well how hard it is to find a decent place to eat out in the city, let alone a spot that serves tasty creative cuisine. Well, Relais de Paris does all that and it does it pretty well. I went there on a cold late october day, for lunch with husband and mum, having read positive opinions on Trip Adv. We were warmly greeted and shown to our table by Philippe, the manager. We chose from the blackboard the ""suggestions du chef"" rather than from the menu and we did well! Food was fantastic. We still remember the yummy goat cheese ""aumoniere"" and the delicious magret de canard served with ""fruits caramélisés"". What is also great about this place is that they use local products. Definitely worth a trip next time you happen to be in Meknes. We, for sure, will happily pay another visit!",Tripadvisor

Meknes,Restaurant,Riad Ritaj,Excellent family option in the heart of Meknes,"We stayed at the Riad Ritaj during our family trip through Morocco, with two children aged 6 and 9, and it was quite a success. They have spacious and comfortable family rooms, perfect for lounging after a day of exploring.

The location is ideal: attached to the main square and a step from the medina. Very practical if you are traveling with children.

The riad is nice, cozy and charming. The staff is very friendly and hospitable. We loved how we were greeted with tea and pasta, a gesture that became a moment of calm and welcome.

And the breakfast... amazing: hearty, varied and with local products. A luxury to start the day like this.

Our room overlooked the street access to the medina, so there was some noise at night. If you are very sensitive to sound, you may notice. But we... fell asleep like a street babe from Meknes!

Definitely an excellent base to discover Meknes as a family. Highly recommended!",Tripadvisor

Tetouan,Hotel,Blanco Riad Hotel & Restaurant,Riad to avoid,"Riad too loud at all hours unfortunately. The rooms are not well insulated so you can even hear the ringing of the phone at the reception and the bell for entry into the riad.
Every time you walk down the guest staircase you hear a noise as if the bedroom door is open.
Accessibility to the riad is very complicated and if you are driven it is catastrophic (no parking).
The price of my night is far too expensive considering the services.
In conclusion I advise against",Tripadvisor
Tetouan,Hotel,Blanco Riad Hotel & Restaurant,Hidden gem,"What a fabulous mini break, and the Riad was just perfect for our needs.

Our rooms were bright and airy, with comfortable beds, beautiful laundered cotton sheets, fluffy towels and powerful showers.

Tetouan,Hotel,Hotel Atenas,Basic hotel almost in the center of Tetouan,"I stayed with a friend at Hotel Athens to visit Tetouan for two days. The location is almost perfect, adjoining the center and relatively close to the medina and other places of interest, in a few minutes you got everywhere.

The rooms were not bad, although they were not very spacious fulfilled their function, as well as the bathroom. In general we rested well except that in the early mornings we were awakened by the sound of the mosque calling worshippers to pray.

The breakfast has nothing special, there is little variety and also served us, like the rest of guests, a couple of glasses with industrial juice that we did not want and that we had not ordered (this would be a detail to improve).

Another detail that we did not like at all was that a couple of hours before Check-out we decided to go for a last walk around the hotel, and as we left the receptionist (tall, brunette and wearing glasses) caught our attention pointing to the watch on his wrist, that we did not throw off and that we had to be prepared because the room had to leave at the stipulated time. We knew this perfectly well and had plenty of time to leave a while before the rush hour, we replied that we considered it and not to worry, and the truth is that we had no problem in the end but that gesture seemed unnecessary and somehow harassing.

They should improve that kind of detail a bit if they want to remain a 3-star hotel or even go up to 4.",Tripadvisor
Tetouan,Hotel,Hotel Atenas,8/10,"The hotel is very well located in the “new” town of Tatouan. The staff are excellent- helpful and friendly. The rooms are basic but very adequate. No fault to them. Quibbles include the fact that the hotel does not have a bar in the accepted sense of that word. It does not serve alcohol of any description. The “mini bar” in each room is , in fact, a very of and totally empty fridge. It is not even plugged in.
The breakfast is included in the price if the room. You would certainly have plenty to eat and would never leave while still feeling hungry. However, as we stated several nights there we learned the breakfast never changes. It is precisely the same every morning. After 4 nights it has become very boring.
The hotel - especially Mohammed in reception- organised an English speaking guide at a reasonable cost. The guide was very friendly and informative.
I would recommend the hotel without hesitation but don’t expect it to be like a European hotel.",Tripadvisor
Tetouan,Hotel,Hotel Atenas,A receptionist wanted to scam us,"We stayed at the hotel for 7 days. A reception employee, we are not sure if he is a reception manager or an employee, deceived us on several occasions. Every time we asked him for information about a place and ordered a taxi, he called someone he trusted and raised the price when a taxi on the street was much lower... he tricked us into keeping the money. This boy is short, thin and dark, I don't know his name because he didn't have an identification plate on his shirt. He has very few social skills with the client. Sometimes he spoke to us with little respect and with a lot of arrogance. He yelled at his own teammates and did not treat them well. Never in my life have I encountered a front-of-house receptionist with so little education and social skills. The other receptionists were lovely. Always with a smile and willing to help. In general, the other hotel employees were very friendly except for this man, who wanted to make a killing by deceiving the client and filling his pocket.",Tripadvisor

The dining room also serves dinner - there are restaurants nearby but a good many of them appear to cater only to men (some have upstairs seating) - so that was a good solution for me.

In addition, the property is very dirty, there are always non-guests who accost women at night inside the Inn. The Pension is filled with screaming children by the pool (who also need cleaning).

Tetouan,Hotel,Marina Smir Hotel & Spa,Magical atmosphere... great location!,"The only negative aspect I can think of is the fact that we only spent one night at Marina Smir Hotel. It is by far the most charming and welcoming hotel we have visited during our stay in Morocco.

We arrived at the hotel on 19th April 2019, right in time for dinner. The food was excellent and the staff ready to help, waiting for us to settle down and enjoy our evening.

We had a very positive experience at the Marina Smir Hotel. It is set right on the beach, with a great Mediterranean view from the room balcony... just that makes for a wonderful stay. The location is also a few steps from the marina and promenade of restaurants which one can access directly from the hotel gardens, guarded 24/7 so avoid random people entering the premises.

The room was clean and well maintained, although all in all the hotel does need some upgrade and refurbishment, as there is so much potential in it. Service was good but slow at times. We went for a walk by the marina in the evening and on our return we sat down at the outside terrace of the bar. We ordered the traditional Moroccan mint tea... half an hour waiting and never came!

The architecture of this hotel provides a magical sensation, a superb example of Moorish Andalusian finishings. Marina Smir Hotel is located not far from the towns of Tetouan and Ceuta, and is housed within beautiful gardens, offering serene spirituality and helping to make it a peaceful place to relax and rest.

Tetouan,Hotel,Marina Smir Hotel & Spa,HORRIBLE DISGUSTING HOTEL,"We used to come to this hotel in the past, and actually have a pleasant stay. This year was a total shock: 
1- Dirty rooms,especially the bathroom (repulsive smells & else). 
2- two cockroaches in the shower
3- bad quality music at night keeping us up (the room they gave us was in the ground floor, so we could hear everything. 
4- we asked for a change of room the next morning; a request to which the person in charge responded positively and YET, nothing happened. 
5- while lying down in bed after a nap, we are horrified to find strangers in our room (the person in charge of taking a family in their room brought them to ours, did not knock & did not apologize late on; leaving us in complete disbelief. 
6- broken phone 
7- bad food
8- the beach in front of a hotel is one of the dirtiest Ive ever seen. 
 The list is long, but this hotel deserves a 0 star & should closed  Until they improve the situation. 
The views are nice, which is too bad because with all these issues, you just wanna leave.",Tripadvisor

We had the most frightening experience of our lives in this hotel. At 6am, a man was able to break into our room, when we were two young women asleep inside.

The most shocking thing? It was the hotel itself that gave him the information about our room and provided him with an access card. No controls, no verification, no security. This man found himself in our room, terrorizing us — we were very afraid for our safety.

And despite the seriousness of the incident, the institution never apologized or took responsibility. No support, no empathy, no professionalism.

We're still in shock. A hotel that puts its guests at risk and protects an intruder instead of its own guests is an establishment that must absolutely be avoided. Your safety means nothing to them. A hotel that does this cannot be trusted under any circumstances.",Tripadvisor

Tetouan,Hotel,Hotel Tamuda Beach,If you are not looking for something special,"We have been to the hotel with the family in December 2016 during a holiday break. We have selected Tamuda Beach as almost all hotels in the area were fully booked and it had a nice review. Upon arrival we noticed the huge hotel is almost empty. The facilities, shop and restaurant were closed. Dinner consists of snacks, panini or frozen pizza served in the snack bar where you get the breakfast as well. 
Rooms are big, nice and clean. Family rooms have no sea view but all overlook a big white wall with not much of the sunlight getting in. 
Personnel is nice and smiling although they wanted to ensure at all cost that we pay in advance even though they had our passports with them. 
Overall the hotel might be nice in summer but visibly they do not put the effort on off-season services although they are open. This is strange as all other hotels are full in the area so it is surely not down to a lack of potential clients.",Tripadvisor

Tetouan,Hotel,Hotel Marina,Comfortable bed and nice staff,"We booked a standard room and the value of money was ok. There was no AC in the rooms so we couldn't sleep at night and had to open the windows but the noise from the street was deafening, moreover the smell of smoking kept seeping inside the room from outside. Also the rooms are not cleaned every day only when you enter or leave the room. It's a bit far from the center of the city with the old medina so you need to take a Taxi to go and come back. They have a restaurant but the prices are steep so eat outside downtown.",Tripadvisor

Tetouan,Hotel,Hotel Marina,"Great budget hotel, good for a first-night stay","Having arrived at Ceuta, it was good to find this little budget hotel for a first night stay in Morocco, and it is is situated close to the railway station.   We paid just 300 dirhams for room 326 which was a very large room with 1 double and 1 single bed. However, it had a tiny bathroom.   There  was a small cafe on the first floor which served just basic refreshments but for an evening meal, we were recommended by the staff to a local cafe just 100metres down the road.    This was very much a local place, well used by locals and serving typical Moroccan food.  Not at all a smart place but provided excellent, cheap food.",Tripadvisor
Tetouan,Hotel,Riad Las Mil y una Noches,Well received,"From the first moment we felt at home in this hotel, thanks to the cordial and professional reception we received from hotel manager Osama. His kindness and dedication set the tone for the entire stay.

Having breakfast on the roof terrace was a fantastic experience – in a charming, rural setting with a genuine Moroccan atmosphere. A perfect start to the day!

The room was clean, well organized and beautifully decorated with details that brought to mind the stories in One Thousand and One Nights. The hotel also offers free drinking water and fast wifi, which we really appreciated.

What really made our stay special was the staff: Osama, and the two young men Aziz and Suleiman, who were both helpful and incredibly nice. In addition, we want to highlight the two women who work with cleaning and breakfast – very respectful and friendly.

We are grateful for everything and will be happy to come back. Highly recommended!",Tripadvisor

Tetouan,Restaurant,Diamond Tetouan,You should read !!!!,"Terrible experience at this café-restaurant. Respect for customers is simply non-existent. Some of the staff (not all, but enough to ruin the experience) are downright rude and seem to judge people based on how they dress or look — which is absolutely disgraceful and discriminatory.

Their main focus is clearly not on customer service, but on making as much money as possible. During the summer season, they do everything they can to attract people, but once the place gets busy, their behavior changes completely. They become arrogant, unfriendly, and — believe it or not — they will shamelessly ask certain customers to leave if they’re not spending “enough” money!

This kind of attitude has no place in hospitality. Tourists, please be aware: there are many other places where you’ll be welcomed with kindness, respect, and professionalism. Don’t waste your time or money here. This place doesn’t deserve your business.",Tripadvisor

Was a tip from the host of our Riad otherwise we would have walked right past it. They have a kind of courtyard garden between the buildings where you eat. The couscous and the calimari are absolutely top notch. They also serve alcohol for the enthusiasts. Very price friendly too. We ate together (1 starter and both a main course) plus drinks for €35. Only downside was that there are insects (wasps) flying around that can be irritating. Waiters are modest, can show a little more spontaneity. But all in all very satisfied!",Tripadvisor

Tetouan,Restaurant,Restinga,Very Disappointing,"I have been in country for almost 4 weeks now travelling from southern Morocco into the Sahara and back up to Tangier, and I have to say this is one of the most disappointing meals I have had. I was tossing between this place and El Reducto. The Moroccan salad was very watery - when I finished it, there was about a inch of what I assume was “dressing” in the bottom of the bowl, but it didn’t really have any flavour. But more disappointing was the chicken tagine. It arrrived in a lukewarm tagine (it had obviously been cooked elsewhere and then put into the tagine before serving) and there was literally a chicken leg and bit of thigh with a few olives. The chips had been cooked in oil that wasn’t hot enough - so they had soaked up the grease (although to their merit - they were hot, unlike the chicken). I literally ate here, waited an hour or so and then went and ate at El Reducto. I hadn’t planned on having dinner twice but was still hungry. The best part of the meal was the beer. Very disappointing.",Tripadvisor

I had to ask the waiter several times to hand in the missing items and was simply ignored each time. My child lacked the drink for breakfast (cocoa), and even after repeated prompting, it was not served. The child cried at the end because everyone had their drinks and finished breakfast and he is still waiting for his drink 😢. He couldn't have breakfast without a drink. Guests came after us and were completely served before us and we still had to wait for the missing things. Not even water, which is part of the menu, was served to us! After waiting more than an hour for the missing items, I freaked out and complained to the boss about the disastrous service, especially that no consideration is given to the children. When paying, things were calculated that were not served at all; just outrageous 😡. I will never visit the restaurant again!",Tripadvisor

A humiliating and shocking experience! I visited this restaurant in Tetouan with my wife, and we were greeted by an extremely rude and arrogant employee. As soon as we arrived, he would talk to the clients as if he were lecturing them. When I asked what was in a panini, he replied in a mocking tone: ""Don't you know chicken means chicken?"" And when I asked if they had table service, he said contemptuously: “Are you still small to talk about that?”

After the meal, I expressed my displeasure politely, telling him that his behavior does not make him want to come back. We came out very upset, and my wife forgot her computer. When she came back for him, he insulted her by saying: “Your husband is ill-educated, tell him not to talk too much.” I then called to protest, but he started threatening and insulting me on the phone: “I’m here until 2am, come if you want.”

No professionalism, total shame. To flee absolutely!

A humiliating and shocking experience! I visited this restaurant in Tetouan with my wife, and we were met with the rudest staff member I’ve ever encountered. From the start, he spoke to customers in a condescending tone, as if educating them. When I asked what was in a panini, he sarcastically replied, “Don’t you know chicken means chicken in Arabic?” And when I inquired about table service, he mocked me saying, “You’re still too young to talk about that?”

After finishing the meal, I told him that his behavior was unprofessional and that I wouldn’t come back. We left upset, and my wife accidentally left her laptop. When she returned to get it, he verbally attacked her and said, “Your husband is rude, tell him not to talk too much.” I called to confront him, and he started threatening and insulting me on the phone: “I’m here until 2 AM, come if you want.”

This restaurant is a disgrace. Completely unprofessional. Avoid it at all costs!

Tetouan,Restaurant,Olas,Olas M’diq 👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼,"I ordered crab’s croquettes as a starter and a Moroccan chicken Tagine as a main meal… 

They served me rice and zaalouk and potatoes and bread at first, all of that was cold and not suitable to eat… zaalouk was okay. 

After, they served me the Tajine, and it was so poor with a lot of sauce and fries (which wasn’t mentioned on the menu)… i felt stomach aches later. 

Also the waiter wasn’t nice! 

Overall, it was a very poor experience",Tripadvisor
Tetouan,Restaurant,Olas,A disappointment.,"Dirty table and not set up, after claim the waiter did not like everything as if it was my fault, a fish tagine that looked like a fish soup, in my opinion the Chef de cuisine is not the same.

Tetouan,Restaurant,Olas,Absolutely Appalling!,"This is the worst “restaurant” we have ever been in, mainly due to the bad-mannered waiters.
We visited a few times, giving them the benefit of our initial doubts, but each visit was worse! 
Twice we witnessed a waiter habing a loud and most discourteous argument with diners
and people left in tears!
Avoid it at all costs!  Surrounding restaurants are far better in every possible way!",Tripadvisor

Al Hoceima,Hotel,Mercure Quemado Resort Hotel,"A pleasant setting, but a very disappointing experience","We had originally booked at Hotel Quemado, but upon receipt of the confirmation, we discovered that it related to Hotel Mohammed V, without any explanation. If we had not taken the time to check, we would have been very surprised when we arrived. It was necessary to call to correct the reservation, which is not normal for an establishment of this level.

The hotel’s location remains a real asset, with a beautiful sea view, but this does not compensate for the many disappointments encountered on site.

The elevator is constantly occupied by staff, which creates very long waits, especially when staying on the upper floors.

The cleanliness of the rooms clearly leaves something to be desired: dust under the beds, poorly cleaned floor, rough towels... We are far from expected standards.

The catering rates are excessive and unjustified in view of the quality offered.

Fortunately, the reception staff stands out for their professionalism and kindness. Animation for children is also a positive point to highlight.

In summary, despite some positives, I would not recommend this hotel to my loved ones.",Tripadvisor

The coach from Tangiers to Al Hoceima is about ten hours and there isn't a straight or level mile! we traveled on a overnight coach to Al Hoceima and it was extremely uncomfortable, almost an ordeal! we traveled back to Tangiers on a day coach and had a more comfortable time.",Tripadvisor

Al Hoceima,Hotel,Hotel Villa Florido,Good value for the area,"We stayed here for a week and the hotel itself was really good. We first accepted a room on the first floor that was really noisy but we were moved the next day and all was good from there.
The rooms are well set up, beds comfortable, bathrooms clean and your room will be serviced if you leave the key when you go out.
Staff do not speak a lot of English but Mike the manager does and if in doubt ask for him.
Breakfast is served downstairs in the cafe and is good, 40dhm for a huge breakfast or 17 for a smaller version.
There are a few restaurants around for other meals although we struggled to find anyone who spoke any English (but we are in a non English speaking country is accept that is part of it) As you walk out of the hotel there is an allley with a small cafe set up the food there is excellent and very cheap, they were always welcoming and friendly when we went there. The Sardines are really good :-)",Tripadvisor
Al Hoceima,Hotel,Hotel Villa Florido,good value but can be noisy,"We only stayed in Al Hoceima for one night en route to Chefchaoeun, and the Villa Florido was certainly good value (less than 300 Dhs for a double room). We could also park for free right outside the hotel entrance. Staff were friendly, the room was clean. The fish restaurants down at the Al Hoceima port are also well worth checking out. Just be aware that the hotel is located at the junction of two busy commercial streets and Place du Rif in the city centre; light sleepers should bring ear-plugs.",Tripadvisor

Al Hoceima,Hotel,Hotel Villa Florido,Centrally located art deco gem,"Although I have visited Morocco many times before, Al Hoceima never made my itinerary. Well, what a beautiful place. The locals are extremely friendly with absolutely zero hassle. Great sea food as you might expect from a seaside town. Great scenery in the national park to the west.

Villa Florido staff were helpful, my first room (304) was quite good, though I checked out the next morning uncertain whether I would be staying in the town. But after a day in the national park to the west I was drawn back and checked into Villa Florido again. This time the room overlooked the Place du Rif with the grand taxis and it was noisy. So when I decided to stay another night I changed to room 208 which had double aspect balconies facing the opposite direction. The hotel is reasonable value at 258dh for an ensuite with breakfast (single price), double occupancy would be cheaper per person.",Tripadvisor

Al Hoceima,Hotel,Suites Hotel Mohammed V by Accor,"Great location, good rooms, ok staff","We stayed two nights at thet Suites Mohammed V in Al Hoceima in August 2012. Great view (although the newly built hotel right at the beach is clogging the view a bit), good beds, friendly staff. The shower turns the bathroom into a pool because the water leaks right onto the bathroom floor (in both rooms the same problem so I presume it's in all rooms). Slightly overpriced all in all.",Tripadvisor
Al Hoceima,Hotel,Suites Hotel Mohammed V by Accor,"Decent hotel, great view, excellent location","There really aren't any top level choices for hotels in Al Hoceima. The Suites Hotel Mohammed V is the best one that I have found. It is very conveniently located right next to the central square of the city, Place Mohammed VI, on the side of a hill looking directly out over the beautiful small beach of Quemada.
The rooms are all ""suites"" -- larger than the average room with a sitting area, flat screen television, large and very comfortable bed, balcony overlooking the beach, separate bathroom and shower/bathtub. The hotel underwent major renovation and opened just early in 2011. It is totally different than it was previously.
The hotel also has a nice restaurant on the bottom floor which also serves the complimentary breakfast. There is a bar on the main floor that had just received a liquor license and was serving a variety of drinks. Prices in the bar and the restaurant were not outrageous. Internet connectivity was provided by WIFI in the reception area and some of the rooms and then wired internet in the rooms. I stayed for two weeks for business and the internet was frustrating as it would work for a while, stop for half an hour, come back up and then go down again. Everyone in the hotel complained about the internet (which was free), but you get what you pay for.
Personnel were very friendly. There is a parking area directly in front of the hotel and had sufficient places for all those who were staying in the hotel. There was a security man around the hotel in the night time. The hotel is actually three floors. You enter on the main reception floor and then there are two floors down by elevator where the rooms are. The hotel does not have a swimming pool, nor does it have a fitness center (although they said one was being finished and the hotel brochure actually claims that there is one).
Room prices were reasonable for the quality. I did have a problem with the shower door not closing properly and water would constantly get onto the floor. It wasn't a flood, but had to be careful when stepping out of the shower onto the marble floors to be sure I didn't slip and fall.
I previously stayed in Al Hoceima at the Hotel La Perla. The Suites Hotel Mohammed V is considerably better than La Perla. I enjoyed my two week stay in the hotel and have no problems recommending it to other travelers. Because of the hotel's excellent location, there were a number of other locations to eat within easy walking distance.",Tripadvisor
Al Hoceima,Hotel,Suites Hotel Mohammed V by Accor,"Nice and new, pleasant contemporary design","Very nice renovation and extra large bedrooms. The quality of finishings is not up to standard though, our shower screen was badly fitted and could not close, the door handle on the balcony door was damanaged, one of the window in the corridor was loose and about to fall, one of the glass doors of the restaurant was badly cracked. Also, the restaurant floor was really dirty, which is a real shame for such an upscale establishment. One last thing: changer les deux tapis rouges du hall, there are much better ones everywhere else!",Tripadvisor
Al Hoceima,Hotel,Hotel Basilic,Nice experience,"We had the opportunity to eat lunch and evening on the terrace on the 7th floor, the view is beautiful, the meal was excellent. The octopus very fresh and wonderfully well cooked and the little more I would even add a star for the waiter ""simon"" who welcomed us super well with impeccable service which is rare in some restaurants. This very smiling and friendly gentleman was the little plus of our evening we hope to see him again next year.",Tripadvisor
Al Hoceima,Hotel,Hotel Basilic,Lunch,"Too much waiting to order and to be served and servers not smiling. Juices not sweet and lunch not seasoned enough. In terms of cleanliness, not too much under the dirty table, chair and table the same despite it being well located.",Tripadvisor
Al Hoceima,Hotel,Hotel Basilic,If there was a rating less than one star then I would have used it,"We came in with two mini dogs leashed. The waiter said welcome. Then once we were seated in the terrace.  There was an instant change of rules. A sign with `no dogs` was printed and stack on the entrance door.

Then the waiter was ignoring us. And came to say that we are denied service because we had dogs.

One the way out, we have seen the freshly printed sign denying access to dogs.

There are a million other places to drink your coffee. Don't give your money to dishonest people. (Photo not from Basilisk).",Tripadvisor
Al Hoceima,Hotel,Hotel Basilic,Mediocre & overpriced,"This is one of the few places for a light meal open fairly late in Al Hoceima (or so we found in early Oct 2017).  It has an attractive and large café terrace on the main square of the town.   The menu is quite extensive.   Except for a caprese salad which was rather good, the food is nothing special - we had hamburgers.  Service was unattentive - although there were only two or three other tables, the waiter seemed to be doing us a favour by serving us.   It was, all in all, rather boring.  Prices quite high too, I thought, and unjustified.  One is paying for convenience and location in a town in which fastfood seems to be the main entertainment when it comes to food.   Amazing when you see all the fresh produce in the markets ...",Tripadvisor

I had ice cream and the wife had a pancake with banana and caramel. 

The pancake was heavy, but I guess if you like pancakes that way you will love it. Personally I like my pancakes light but that's just me :-)

The ice cream was one of the best I have had for a long time. It was creamy and delicious so if you love ice cream you should definitely try out this place. 

The WiFi is free but we didn't get it to work.

Al Hoceima,Hotel,Hotel Basilic,A 4 Star Hotel Experience at 3 Star Price,"This hotel is only rated 3 stars but was easily the nicest hotel we stayed in during our trip to Morocco (Casablanca, Rabat, Tangier, Hoceima). It feels very new and is in a perfect location right on the square with magnificent views of the bay.

It is best to get a room on the higher floors (5 or 6) for this view. Rooms were large, clean and modern. The bathroom was modern and comfortable. There are no king beds but we had two twins pushed together. There are not many amenities but the room is very comfortable and includes a small balcony.

Breakfast is included and is to order (much better option than a buffet with tired food). Service in the cafe was excellent and the food very tasty.

Overall, this felt much more like a 4 star experience for a 3 star price. We were very, very pleased and we travel a lot (75% of the time). You can't go wrong with this hotel.",Tripadvisor

Al Hoceima,Hotel,Aline Hostel,WARNING !!! HOSTEL IS HEAVILY INFESTED WITH BEDBUGS. THE HOSTEL HAVE REFUSED TO SORT THIS OUT FOR OVER A YEAR,"It didn’t take me long to notice that the bed I was sleeping in felt slightly itchy. I tossed and turned and listened to others in the room itching. I thought there must have been a couple of mozzies in the room.

5 hours later.. I still hadn’t slept, trying in the common room and the terrace. Everything was itchy!! I woke with at least 20 marks all over my body. Some have turned into boils and others are the size of an egg.

Looking at the edges of the beds in the morning, you can see there are eggs in the mattresses. There are many reviews saying that this hostel is heavily infested with bedbugs, some dating back to the summer of 2018 (a year later!!) This clearly demonstrates that there is no appetite to fix this problem. The hostel weren’t particularly apoplectic and tried to play it off as something normal stating that ‘People come and go and bring them all of the time. Nothing we can do’. I pointed out that no other hostel we have stayed in so far has had this problem. It’s a shame as the hostel its self had a lovely terrace and is located in a nice area.

Please, do not stay here. They need a reason to sort out this problem.",Tripadvisor
Al Hoceima,Hotel,Aline Hostel,Bedbucks,"I have to say that- got bitten all over by bedbucks. Told the owner and he said they gonna change everything.Anyways he said: that's only bites (sure, but these little bustards just let me sleep 3 hours, so for what I am actually paying for???) Later on came back to get my luggage and checked the room- they just prepared everything for the next guest. They just don't care! Ask at breakfast for a second coffee, cause I haven't slept- ""no more coffee' Floor under the bed full of dust! Blankets were smelling like cheese!
But I got charged for a full night for like 3 hours sleep and 20 bites which got swollen. Really not ok!!!",Tripadvisor

Nice spacious room with recently renovated bathroom,food in the restaurant was tasty and the garden and swimmingpool were clean and really nice. They say the tapwater is drinkable, we didn't want to take the gamble and ordered a liter bottle of water but 50 Dirham or € 5 seemed a bit out of place.",Tripadvisor
Al Hoceima,Hotel,Hotel Al Khaima,Avoid this Hotel - is a disaster,"ve stayed at this hotel three times, and each time it gets worse. This last visit was absolutely unacceptable.

• No Hot Water: I asked for hot water three times, and each time I was given excuses. They claimed the water heater was broken, but it was clear they deliberately shut off the hot water when there weren’t enough guests. When a group of Asian tourists arrived, the hot water was suddenly available, but as soon as they left, it was turned off again. As a Moroccan from Canada visiting my home country, I found this treatment deeply disrespectful. It seems they prioritize foreign tourists over locals.
• Terrible Rooms: The rooms are outdated, smell awful, and are not clean. The faucet in my bathroom was broken, adding to the frustration.
• Inedible Breakfast: While breakfast was included, it was so bad that it was practically inedible. The cheese was spoiled, and the overall quality was extremely poor.
• No Accountability: Despite all these issues, they still charged me full price without offering any discount, apology, or acknowledgment of their terrible service. The lack of consideration is shocking.

This place is a disaster. I would strongly advise anyone to avoid staying here. It’s not worth the money or the stress.",Tripadvisor

The seafood was so fresh and the calamari rings were incredible. A mixture of prawns, swordfish, white fish and squid. I got chatting to the owner whilst he was tending to the garden. He obviously takes a lot of care, the garden was so beautiful and he brought me fresh flowers for the table. I ended up spending the day there and relaxed by the pool and took a swim. I wish I had booked here instead of my apartment as it is difficult for a female solo traveller to find relaxed spaces to sunbathe and feel comfortable alone at the beach. The care, attention and hospitality at this hotel is 10/10. I loved the music too that came on early evening, they were getting ready for a birthday party on the terrace overlooking the sea, so nice, what a fantastic venue for a celebration! Alcohol is not served in this part of the hotel, or the restaurant which I thought was very respectful towards the local people. I would 100% book this hotel for a future visit to Asilah and I thank you so much to the owner Sharif and his staff for looking after me so well :)",Tripadvisor
Al Hoceima,Hotel,Hotel Al Khaima,Good location right along the beach and beautiful beach,Friendly staff. Beautiful grounds and right near the beach. Recommend just using the pool though because the beach is quite dirty and smelly. Rooms were quite spacious and had a balcony overlooking the main area where the pool was. Breakfast was basic but delicious.,Tripadvisor
Al Hoceima,Hotel,Hotel Al Khaima,Noisy from the nightclub,Bathroom mat was soaking wet when we entered the room. The bathroom and front door don’t close properly and swing open.

Al Hoceima,Restaurant,Mercure Quemado Resort Hotel,"A pleasant setting, but a very disappointing experience","We had originally booked at Hotel Quemado, but upon receipt of the confirmation, we discovered that it related to Hotel Mohammed V, without any explanation. If we had not taken the time to check, we would have been very surprised when we arrived. It was necessary to call to correct the reservation, which is not normal for an establishment of this level.

The hotel’s location remains a real asset, with a beautiful sea view, but this does not compensate for the many disappointments encountered on site.

The elevator is constantly occupied by staff, which creates very long waits, especially when staying on the upper floors.

The cleanliness of the rooms clearly leaves something to be desired: dust under the beds, poorly cleaned floor, rough towels... We are far from expected standards.

The catering rates are excessive and unjustified in view of the quality offered.

Fortunately, the reception staff stands out for their professionalism and kindness. Animation for children is also a positive point to highlight.

In summary, despite some positives, I would not recommend this hotel to my loved ones.",Tripadvisor

Al Hoceima,Restaurant,Hotel La Perla,Good value hotel in the middle of Al Hoceima,"I just finished a two day stay in this multi-story hotel in Al Hoceima on the northern coast of Morocco. It is a three star hotel nicely located in the middle of downtown Al Hoceima. It has about 30 rooms. The rooms are on the small side, but are clean as are the bathrooms. The restaurant was more than acceptable specializing in local fish dishes. The local calamari was excellent. The service in the hotel and the restaurant was also excellent. The hotel offers free internet in the rooms (with a cable they provide) or free WIFI in the lobby/reception area. The internet worked very well. There was plenty of hot water in the showers and the wall mounted air conditioner/heater worked well. Since the hotel is in the middle of town, and across the street from a small soccer stadium, it can be noisy at times. I didn't notice it as much as my colleagues did (and my room faced the street). There is very little choice in Al Hoceima and this hotel is perfectly suitable. Parking was available in front of the hotel on the street and a parking attendant was present to watch the cars at night. The hotel is also very convenient to the port which is only about five minutes away.",Tripadvisor

And the Couscous was a good surprise because everywhere we went we were told that Couscous is only available on Fridays. Today is Sunday and this place doesn’t abide by that rule. It was a good and large meal especially the beef one. Ended the course with Moroccan tea and pastries. Paid 200 dirhams for a dinner for two including tip and it was worth it. This is less than US $25. Note that they don’t accept credit cards. Highly recommended.,Tripadvisor

But above all, it is Lutfi, the owner who makes the big difference. He will come to pick you up whether you arrive by train, plane or taxi.

Oujda,Restaurant,WILD - Creative Bar & Spring Rolls Restaurant,Tasty Spring Rolls,"Vild in Siem Reap isn't just a restaurant, it's a culinary experience that will redefine your perception of the humble spring roll. Forget everything you thought you knew, because this place takes the classic to dizzying new heights with an imaginative array of variations that are nothing short of genius.
From the moment you step in, you're greeted with a vibrant, inviting atmosphere. But the real magic begins when the food arrives. Each spring roll is a miniature work of art, bursting with fresh, vibrant flavors. I tried a selection, and honestly, every single one was a revelation. The fillings range from traditional to daringly innovative - and with surprisingly rich vegetarian options, and even a dessert spring roll that blew my mind. The textures are perfect, the ingredients are incredibly fresh, and the dipping sauces are crafted to complement each unique roll perfectly.
The concept of a restaurant solely dedicated to spring rolls might seem niche, but Vild proves it's a winning formula when executed with such passion and creativity. The service was attentive and knowledgeable, guiding me through the extensive menu with enthusiasm. If you're looking for an unforgettable meal in Siem Reap that's both delicious and incredibly unique, do yourself a favor and visit Vild. It's easily a 5-star experience and a must-try for any food lover!",Tripadvisor

Saidia,Hotel,Be Live Collection Saïdia,Not coming back,"A hotel that does not correspond at all to a 5*. I've been to 3* hotels in much, much higher.
Food varied and with little choice, even being aware that we are in Africa.
Common areas (mainly bar access to the pool) without any cleaning and with very bad smell. They only care about cleaning the floor of the buffet support bathrooms, but forget about everything else.
Spacious room, but with bad bath area, including with open door access to tubes. Taking a bath in the late afternoon is an almost impossible task, since the water has only one wire running in the shower, virtually without any pressure. Hotel deserved a very big upgrade in the bathrooms of the rooms. Gel washing hands is a very scarce.
It was appreciated by the staff of the bars (mainly the Lobby and the Moroccan bar) and some members of the animation, who seek to create good moments, as well as positively highlight the pools.
However, no one respects the hotel's rules and there's no one watching these situations.
A place to never go back, for sure.
And, as I've seen in response to other comments, the hotel says it will try to improve, but it's not what you see...",Tripadvisor

Saidia,Hotel,Be Live Collection Saïdia,Disappointing experience – hotel to avoid,"I stayed for 7 days and honestly do not recommend this hotel to anyone.

Right on the first day, the room was changed and the reception showed total disinterest in resolving the situation. During the stay, bed linen was not changed, while bath towels (used only once) were changed daily, but the foot towel was systematically forgotten. The toilet paper looked like a luxury item, it had to be ordered several times and without ever making its replacement, forcing to go to the cleaning team directly, the reception ignored it.

In the bathroom, we suffered a flood. For two days, the “solution” was to put towels on the floor, only on the third day they arranged the tubes from the toilet. Not to mention that I called 4 times and went personally to the reception 2 times, and not so, being obliged to contact the guide of the travel agency to resolve this matter.

Food was one of the most negative points.
Extremely repetitive and of poor quality:
• Breakfast: exposed yogurts without refrigeration, in large cups, at considerable heat, without any concern for food safety. The omelettes and fried eggs were made in a dirty sheet, rarely cleaned.
• Lunch and dinner: very little variety, always the same proteins day after day.
The same plywood hygiene problems persisted, without care or frequent cleaning.
• Drinks and water: rarely fresh water, without worrying about serving properly. The drinks were served with a lack of hygiene that he had never witnessed in a hotel.

In the dining rooms, general hygiene was virtually nonexistent. I came to see food products packaged directly on the floor before being served, and the staff did not show any care in handling the food.

It was a very bad experience in all aspects, from hygiene to service and food quality. Clearly, a hotel that doesn't care about the guests. I do not recommend at all.",Tripadvisor
Saidia,Hotel,Be Live Collection Saïdia,Perfect.,"Best hotel with an impressive vibe and remarkable services, simo has been helpful since my entire stay me and my friends thank so much for their efforts",Tripadvisor
Saidia,Hotel,Be Live Collection Saïdia,Not advisable,"Generally very weak, 3* at most.
Good rooms, large and with good insulation, toilet with pets in the bath and in poor condition. Insufficient room cleaning as well as no shampoo or bath gel for a week.
Beach with dirty sand, no support bar or toilet. Vendors constantly bother people, who are on holiday and rest.
Pools with plenty of loungers, unfortunately there is no vigilance for the people who ""reserve"" loungers with towels all day and do not appear there (as set out in the hotel regulations).
Very weak animation, few activities and always repeated. Animators encourage guests to rate the Hotel on TripAdvisor.
In addition to considering a huge lack of hygiene to be allowed to enter the pool to people dressed, such as, wash the slippers at the entrance of the pool.
The staff (rescuers) are sitting under a hat, can't speak any language except Arabic and allow everything...even glasses of drinks inside the pool and after empty to serve as bars to play with the water.
Wifi only in the lobby and pool.
Crabs at the buffet and the lobby.
Last but not least the food, a lot of Moroccan variety and few other options. There are pizzas (always the same, with tomato and cheese). All food is sweet, sweet sauces, etc...
Swimming pool snack with few options, many fried, no ice cream or other possible options like dogs or hamburgers. Huge flies on the food.
Bottled water always available.
Hotel in need of many changes, I hope that the less positive reviews, serve for possible improvements for those who visit you.
Finally, I want to thank guide Mahmoud for his professionalism and constant contact.",Tripadvisor

Mind boggling that they spent so much money building that mosque and the city is in a complete state of disrepair",Tripadvisor
Saidia,Restaurant,Casablanca City,City tour,Better plan ur trip what places to visit. You can go with group tour or private. If you go as private family tour then 1st clarify how much you are paying as tour company's driver will ask for money in advance even to pay for patrol. Also ask tour company how long you are going stay there etc. The petrol stations on the dual carriageway are excellent. You can have a nice break i.e. breakfast or a quick snack with drinks all sorts. You need haggle prices to Casablanca as some tour companies can charge ridiculous prices. You can pay up to 1300 Derhams for up to 6 people which is reasonable but plan ahead going at 7 or 8am in the morning and coming back at 16.00 or 17.00.,Tripadvisor
Saidia,Restaurant,Casablanca City,Looks better than it is,Slow service and the food lacked taste. The pizzas were horrible and overpriced. There are so many more better options in Saidia; like buying your own meat/fish on the market and take it to one of their restaurants. They will grill it for you for a few dirhams.,Tripadvisor
Saidia,Restaurant,Casablanca City,As expected minimal changes over time,"Just thought I would update you having finished a guided tour or Casablanca decided to walk it. 6 hours later having walked down most streets in the inner Casablanca found
Nothing like the tourist brochures. 
It is congested just like India rubbish every where derelict vehicles, building in decline. 
It appears infrastructure has not kept up with the population increase. No wonder you are told not to drink the water or touch things . 
All areas outside Casablanca are worth seeing being smaller they are maintained better.
Overall the tour of Morocco was satisfying.",Tripadvisor
Saidia,Restaurant,Casablanca City,Better than anticipated,"Loved the Hassan ll mosque, Moroccan mall , and the Anfa place mall/ Anfa hills area is beautiful .

Laayoune,Hotel,Hotel Parador,Hotel is closed,At the time of writing (March 2023) the hotel was closed and bears no signs that it ever was a hotel. The guard man came out and confirmed that the building had been a hotel but had closed. We ended up at the Sahariano in town which was fine but not a parador by any means.,Tripadvisor
Laayoune,Hotel,Hotel Parador,Hotel in classical style,Hotel Parador is a classic hotel in the style of an arabic palace. Rooms are in good shape and clean. All rooms on the ground floor have a terrace. The main court yard with its fountain is very nice. The restaurant cooks excellent food but presently with a reduced menu. Fruit served on request. Coffee available during the day from the bar. Wine and beer can be ordered in the bar or in the restaurant. Laundry available with swift service. The hotel is a little worn and prices are too high. Would need an update of the whole hotel.,Tripadvisor
Laayoune,Hotel,Hotel Parador,Authentic Charm,"This once top hotel in Laayoune still has authentic charm.
Cool corridors, arched doorways into a large courtyard, huge lounge area with wonderful original ceiling and friendly helpful staff.

Food:
We had dinner at the hotel.
We were the only diners that night.
The menu is in French and as such the cuisine heavily influenced.
Fish soup was ok, the fish fillet and beef we respectively ordered as main courses was surprisingly good.
Breakfast although basic had some local bread type products which were very tasty, jams, yoghurt, good orange juice, coffee, plus the most amazing fresh goats cheese I have ever had, which had actually been made by the guy serving us.
I usually hate goats cheese but really liked this.
Eggs were cooked to order. All sufficient to start the day.

The room:
We had room 109 on the ground floor.
Initially it looked good with its marble floor and fancy sink and tap.
Free bottled water.
Firm bed and comfortable pillows.
However upon closer inspection the bath needed a good clean and the overhead shower just dribbled, to be fair there was a hand held shower which was with lots of hot water.
The wardrobe had just three plastic hangers, no safe and was dusty, as were the drawers.
There was lots of dust and cobwebs under the bed, one power socket was hanging out of the wall.
The room opened onto a garden courtyard but was unpleasant to use due to nesting pigeons and lots of pigeon poo.

This dirty hotel could be great again with very little cost by utilising a proper clean up regime and some basic maintenance.
It is quite sad that it has been left to decline to such a standard.",Tripadvisor
Laayoune,Hotel,Hotel Parador,There were no highlights but plenty of low spots.,Staff condescending. Food below average in a cold soulless dining room served by staff who had no idea.

Nothing to eat! It was interesting story connected with this hotel.

The young man at the Hotel Reception desk was most welcoming and eager to please.  My room was quiet, clean, safe, and very tiny.  Breakfast was served at a large restaurant located on the hotel's top floor.  The city view from there was lovely.  The breakfast buffet had many baked goods to accompany hard-shell boiled eggs. My breakfast latte was delicious.",Tripadvisor

Whatever it lacked in beauty it made up for in charm. The rooms are clean and comfortable, with hot water in the showers. And the restaurant was affordable and very filling. They made us a vegetable tagine that was huge and we couldn't finish! A filling and varied breakfast was also included.

We would also like to say thanks to Mr. Ramadan for his warmth and helpfulness.",Tripadvisor

Laayoune,Hotel,Hotel Casamar,Bets in Tarfaya,"I have stayed at the Casamar and it is the best in Tarfaya. You are less likely to become ill with the food and one of the main points is that due to the location you do not hear all of the noise. No mosques, animals or locals. If you require Wifi you will be required to be selective regarding your room choice. For me it is either staying here or in Laayoune. 

The owner of the hotel is Spanish so he has higher expectaions of what his hotel should be run like. 

If your require a fridge they will put one in your room.

Also, please rememeber that my ratings are that for Tarfaya, if it was scored as to what is expected in Europe it would not do so well.",Tripadvisor

Laayoune,Hotel,Sushikom,Sushikom Elevates Laayune's Sushi Scene,"Sushikom in Laayune is a true standout, offering a take-out sushi experience that defies the norm. Despite limited space for table dining, this hidden gem has set an impressive standard. From the ease of ordering to the secure and visually appealing packaging, every detail reflects a commitment to excellence.

The menu boasts a variety of sushi rolls, sashimi, and nigiri, each piece showcasing fresh ingredients and meticulous preparation. The chefs' dedication to quality is evident in the impeccable taste, with the flavors and textures preserved even during transport.

What makes Sushikom  truly exceptional is its staff. Despite being a take-out joint, their proficiency in English and polite service add an unexpected charm to the experience. Sushikom  has successfully transformed the notion of sushi take-out in a city where it's not the norm.

For anyone craving an outstanding take-out sushi experience in Laayune, Sushikom  is a must-try. Their ability to deliver top-notch quality and service, even without a dine-in option, has undoubtedly elevated the sushi scene in the city. I'm already looking forward to my next sushi adventure with Sushikom

Unfortunately, I missed snapping photos, but Sushikom´s sushi lived up to its online visuals with meticulous presentation and a delightful experience.",Tripadvisor

Laayoune,Hotel,Hotel Rio,"Cash only, new building, poorly trained staff","This hotel and the adjoining Hotel Rio are operated as a single property. Both buildings are new and have fairly large rooms.

No heating (a problem in the winter), and ""the credit card machine is broken"" (in other words, the hotel does not want to accept credit cards - they take cash only).

Located in a quiet area.  Beds are very hard, even by Moroccan standards.

Staff are very poorly trained, with no understanding of the hotel / hospitality business at all.

That notwithstanding, it is suitable for a business traveler,",Tripadvisor

Laayoune,Hotel,Hotel Rio,"Clean, safe and functional","Located on the wrong side of town and about 1km from the middle of the city. OK if you're visiting the university, the courts or the military barracks alongside. The neighbourhood is safe enough if you keep to the main road and well lit streets. Try to avoid entering the residential district opposite and to the left. Otherwise the local area is safe enough and the local people friendly and eager to offer assistance, although maybe only in Arabic, French or maybe Spanish and English only if you're very lucky, as I was.

I had room 317, the suite, at no extra charge. Sumptuous by local standards and just 26 € a night. Very clean in general throughout the hotel, the room was air conditioned, the sheets crisp, towels still white and the elegance of the towel origami on the bed and the provision of a prayer mat an unexpected touch.

The bathroom was serviceable although the water pressure at times was a dribble, especially during power cuts, when the Wi-Fi, air con, lighting and lifts also were out of service. This I believe is unusual, and was the result during my stay of torrential rains (in the Sahara!). The receptionists were very courteous and helpful. I was even offered a candle during the power cut (bring a lighter) and escorted to my room by mobile phone torch.

Breakfast is lots of cut baguette, and typical hotel packed individual butter, marmalade, a pot of yogurt, plus a dish of olive oil and another of olives. The coffee is espresso but the cappuccino almost all froth, as is customary here. Try the local tea, it's quite a ceremony, watch and learn!

I won't be going back to El Aaiun in a hurry, if ever, but I'd stay here again, for the price.",Tripadvisor

Laayoune,Restaurant,Sahariano Hotel City Center,Bad experience – disappointing for bikers on their way to a big event,"We are a group of bikers from several African countries, having come a long way from Dakar to participate in the Road to Marrakech event. Unfortunately, our stay at this property was an unpleasant surprise.

We arrived a little late, tired of the road, but at the reception we were required to pay immediately, without offering any means of payment by card (no TPE). In addition, we were charged an extra room in error, and despite our claims, no refund was given.

This is unfortunate because we always try to promote hospitality and responsible tourism through our travels. This kind of attitude goes against the values of welcome and respect that travellers expect.

We hope this property will improve its service in the future.",Tripadvisor
Laayoune,Restaurant,Sahariano Hotel City Center,Don’t book deluxe - window opens into hallway,"Upon arrival, we were given three room options:

Basic / no window
Deluxe/ window
Suite

We went for the deluxe option specifically to have a window for light and fresh air. Paid 150 dh more per night than the basic option would be. Turns out that the “window” opens into an air shaft with no air circulation and hardly any sunlight. People walking along the hallway can look right onto our bed when the blinds aren’t drawn. So no use at all.

We went back down to reception where we were told that for them, this is a perfectly adequate window and there are no other rooms with proper windows available. We then asked to switch to an economy room (because why pay extra for this?) - no dice. Staff refused to change our booking and kept repeating that we wanted a window and got one. Pretty rude and useless.

It’s like advertising a fridge in the room (and charging for that privilege) that’s not connected to the power. Shame because apart from that the room is fine but from such a high-priced hotel I expect more transparency and honesty.

While we stayed here we heard another two guests complain about the same issue to reception - again, staff did not care and would not change the booking to another category.",Tripadvisor
Laayoune,Restaurant,Sahariano Hotel City Center,The worst is certain,"Great location but lots of false expectations. Just the Abdelbaset boy from reception and his colleague Majda were more than adorable.
Problem on arrival Reservation error despite messages sent and surcharge requested. I found myself in a room with no windows. The host had no commercial move. Problem 2 with friends picking me up the manager was horrible to them and spoke to me very badly as if we were together on the street. Then she sulked and was unprofessional.

Long review: My friend and I are on a motorcycle adventure tour from Denmark to Dakhla and back. When we first passed through Laayoune almost a week ago, we stayed at the Hôtel Al Massira. I regret that now - we should have definitely stayed here both times! The rooms are big and modern, the staff was super helpful and we got to see different rooms in the hotel and choose which one to stay in for the night. Great service!
Moreover, we were initially told to park our motorcycles right outside their big glass windows at the reception for the night. However, the staff later suggested and encouraged us to take the motorcycles inside their (very nice) reception! Very much appreciated and definitely helps keep them more safe during the night.
Mind you, this was done while the reception / café area was still crowded with customers having a late night cup of coffee or tea.",Tripadvisor

The owner couldn´t speak English, but even like that he was very nice and always calling the staff that works for him and that speaks a perfect English.

Dakhla,Hotel,Hotel Erraha,"Great stay, highly recommended","I stayed at the Hotel Erraha for almost a week. When arriving, I did not have any plans, but Charly (and one of his friends) made it sure there was something going on every day.
The hotel is ideally located (althought it may not be evident from the map), at the end of the corniche. facing the park and the mosque.
My room was large (it was actually a small appartment, with 3 separate spaces), nice and clean, with the balcony overlooking the park and (a little further) the sea. 
With wi-fi in the room (and on the balcony) and breakfast included, I found the price to be very reasonable.
I enjoyed my stay in Dakhla a lot and will return to Hotel Erraha for sure.",Tripadvisor
Dakhla,Hotel,Hotel Erraha,"nice people, fair price","Charly, Charles and his team are helpful and honest people. If you have a problem they look for a smart solution, not the most expensive one. Breakfast is fine and upon request an omelette is available. 
The whole hotel is very  windy with a lot of ghost-house noises and clapping windows. Charly: will be looked after ! Big rooms for €18 /night 1 person occupancy. Short shower, has small boiler. Alltogether it is the best hotel in Dakhla, value for money wise.",Tripadvisor
Dakhla,Hotel,Hotel Erraha,Great Stay,"Stayed at the Erraha for a couple of nights over the Xmas break. Charly the hotel owner was the perfect host, offering to pick me up from the airport in Dakhla without charge. The hotel is clean and comfortable and a great location with wifi. I was traveling alone and was offered a room with 2 single beds with a clean toilet and shower. Evenhad a kitchen area. The room was big, satellite TV with hundreds of channels and a fantastic view. Located 10 minutes walk from the centre very near the coast. The room was 200 dirhams per night. Charly is able to help out with local trips and arrange transportation further afield to Mauritania. I felt very safe and comfortable and would have no hesitation to recommend the hotel to others. Went to several other hotels to have a look at their facilities, but for value and comfort the Erraha was certainly the best choice. Can't wait to visit the Erraha again. Dakhla is a fantastic place to stay. Excellent weather, friendly, cheap with no hassles you get in the North. If you are looking for a perfect getaway to unwind look no further than Dakhla and stay at the Erraha. Don't expect 5 star accomodation, it doesn't exist. This is the Western Sahara. What you will get a fantastic experience. Well done Charly and your team.",Tripadvisor

Dakhla,Hotel,Dar Rio Oro,A special time,"I stayed there with my girlfriend in August. The hotel was fairly close to the centre (a 8 min walk) and immediately next to the lagoon, with nice views. 

What made it special is that we felt that we're living in a house with ""heart"". Starting from our chaffeur at the transfer, through the chefs till the hotel director, Daniel (who was substituting the owners at that time), everyone was extremely nice and proactively working on to make our stay exciting in the calm and hollow - albeit very charming - Dakhla. This meant we got a car to drive around (for a very fair price), we could order a home made dinner whenever we wanted, Daniel made us a free quick tour around the city, and he helped us organizing a jeep excursion deep into the Saharan desert, which happened to be our best day in the country, with lots to see, again at a fair price. We felt the staff is really curious about our well-being, maybe because the place is not yet that touristy, but it felt really nice. 

The hotel itself is built in a nice Moroccan style, the room was clean and spacious. I cannot recommend this place enough to anyone who's willing to visit Dakhla - even if you're there just for kitesurfing, it's worth to spend 1-2 nights there, to feel the real atmosphere. :)",Tripadvisor

Dakhla,Restaurant,Hotel Dakhla Attitude,WARNING! Disco Music and party Groups néctar to Dragón Camp bungallows. Impossible to sleep,"WARNING.!!!! They now accept groups who come to party and play very loud music in the bar area next to the Dragon Camp area. It's impossible to sleep until 3 a.m. some days. You pay €180 a night to endure loud music, people shouting and screaming. Attitude is growing rapidly and is no longer the quiet place to relax and kitesurf. After complaining several times at reception, we were told that ""it was what it was"" and there was nothing they could do. We asked them to turn the music down a bit, but they told us that the partygoers would complain (and it was a large group).

si buscas hacer kite es el sitio. si buscas tranquilidad y descanso junto con hacer kite hay dos opciones: ir a otro sitio ( hay mucho en la zona) o preguntar si en la zona del Dragón Camp van a tener grupos organizados que vienen a tener fiesta por la noche.

The most curious thing is that the hotel itself has signs asking guests to refrain from making noise or playing music after 11 a.m. (which is understandable). It seems like it's no longer the Dakhla Attitude it once was, and they're moving on to other things.",Tripadvisor
